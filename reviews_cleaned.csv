"Not Verified | Only the second time flying BA as first time wasn’t positive. Could have made my connection in Heathrow if BA had been proactive. Instead, overnight at the Renaissance hotel compliments of BA. Adequate, but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers. If BA had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving, we could have made our flight and saved BA the cost of rebooking, hotel, shuttle, food accommodations. Another bad show. Business class fare should offer more.",5,2023-05-14, United States ,False,verified second time flying ba first time positive could made connection heathrow ba proactive instead overnight renaissance hotel compliment ba adequate one wonder large part hotel devoted sleeping feeding hundred stranded passenger ba offered one employee help u get gate instead waiting shuttle bus half hour late arriving could made flight saved ba cost rebooking hotel shuttle food accommodation another bad show business class fare offer
"✅ Trip Verified | I wasn't going to bother reviewing this flight as I seem to be on a perpetual downer with BA but the airport experience convinced me otherwise. After having our flight class reduced from First to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in First to make up for the disappointment, they then reneged on this. As it was a special anniversary it sucked. Flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats, at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. Trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. Unbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable. This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food. The crew was great but what an earth is going on at BA, they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time. I say this as the new club suites are great.",3,2023-05-14, United Kingdom ,True,going bother reviewing flight seem perpetual downer ba airport experience convinced otherwise flight class reduced first business offered alternative route outward leg first make disappointment reneged special anniversary sucked flying back checked online chosen window seat gate show passport passport boarding hand luggage trying board passport checked twice issued new boarding card centre seat unbelievable flight quiet half normal crew aircraft unavailable meant pre departure drink limited selection food crew great earth going ba unique knack snatch defeat jaw victory every time say new club suite great
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked business class tickets for my fiancé and I. I had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change, so I called to get have my flight refunded. The representative on the phone informed me he wasn't sure how much I would get, as the refund department needed to check, but estimated I would lose 10-20% of my booking to fees. I accepted. I never got a cancellation email, or any update, but instead received $35 total back. Less than 1% of my booking costs. Since then I have spent over 5 hours calling different departments before they blocked me.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Despite being a gold member, the British Airways staff in Heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service. All the staff members repeat the same mantra - “we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first 24 hours” as if that would make the situation better. There are no proactive updates, no empathy, no care but a lot of actual lies being told. You can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals - they show this in every action and word they say. All of them are better suited to working away from other humans.",1,2023-05-01, United Kingdom ,True,despite gold member british airway staff heathrow literally could care slightest absolute turmoil logistical damage wider impact terrible service staff member repeat mantra obliged provide even update first hour would make situation better proactive update empathy care lot actual lie told tell given care thought passenger actual individual show every action word say better suited working away human
"Not Verified | Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service. If there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days.",2,2023-04-28, United Kingdom ,False,verified regarding aircraft seat business class seat flight pretty good suite type every seat booth sliding door extra privacy downside travelling couple quite difficult interact ample storage usb charging port seat pretty comfortable someone find difficult sleep flight one time able get minute sleep amenity provided pretty average compared airline leather toiletry bag quite nice though slipper pair sock restroom flight small provide much way toiletry compared airline free wi fi business class acceptable another example ba penny pinching recent year regarding staff customer service poor inattentive beyond meal time offer water flight go find attendant ask also offer snack rude time partner asked fork replaced one provided quite clearly dirty attendant incredibly rude response left u shocked different customer seem receive different quality service customer behind repeatedly greeted politely name asked whether needed anything etc whereas partner afforded level personal service disappointing paid price ticket expect level service food pretty bad risotto partner chicken extremely cooked rice looked like porridge vegetable discoloured flavourless bread nice though breakfast much better summary ba become ryanair long haul customer service way would expect premium airline premium seat pay premium price average service option available would choose ba day
"Not Verified | I travelled with British Airways from Sweden to Los Angeles via London in December 2022. When I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missing. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations. I don’t know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me. I am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at British Airways and the lack of customer service.",5,2023-04-26, Sweden ,False,verified travelled british airway sweden los angeles via london december arrived lax one bag missing information whereabouts bag searching someone minute found point contact told bag left behind gave detail would staying told would contact day still contact tried call british airway customer service woman airport give file reference number quite difficult try locate bag finally found reference number bag said would delivered couple day told switched hotel gave address staying everything fine couple week went bag still nowhere seen time fly home airport tried talk personnel try locate bag said delivered first hotel stayed even though given updated address asked since flying home guy counter told problem figure questioned response walked away manager saw came apologized colleague would send someone fetch bag send either flight next one came home couple day later received bag made complaint claim british airway website since buy clothes toiletry vacation bag january said would refund claim april almost may still received refund even multiple email conversation know anymore situation since appears one willing help appalled situation handled frankly disappointed british airway lack customer service
"Not Verified |  Food was lousy. Who ever is planning the Asian Hindu Vegetarian meal is clueless as to what this meal includes. The snack was also lousy.

✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for British Airways. So many issues with getting from one destination to the other. Had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties. I wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 on a $600+ flight. Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. It was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face. I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive. The most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss.,5,2023-04-17, United States ,True,worst experience life trying deal customer service british airway many issue getting one destination absolutely horrible time trying get answer reach anyone capable helping navigate uncertainty wrote formal complaint requesting type refund received generic sorry email avios attached equivalent maybe flight needle say go waste refuse fly untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline even address one single issue expressed equivalent handing band aid slapping face say flight smooth onboard staff kind attentive frustrating thing customer service trained give runaround heavily point exhaustion give trying take loss
"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to code sharing with Cathay Pacific I was downgraded to BA on my return leg. I can’t describe how cheated I felt. I booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, I was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible. To ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts. The cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “You won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know!” the entertainment is compiled mainly of B movies so I paid £11 for Wi-Fi so I could watch Netflix on my laptop. Unsurprisingly, the signal was so weak I couldn’t even send an email. To add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality I have ever seen. Since the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.  What I don’t understand is why it seems that British Airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew.

"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through security. The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays. Priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at Malaga, this is standard for BA business class baggage handling.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible experience. I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse.

The lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and BA has not invested in them for many years. On the flight the food was okay, although portions are kept minimal.

"✅ Trip Verified | Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic and badly organised. Once on board the crew announcements were professional, relaxed and informative in typical BA style. The seat was quite comfortable. It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good. I was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortable. The IFE is excellent, responsive and good quality. There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. Cabin crew were very good. Friendly and efficient. Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough. Landing and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am, even though it was 6:30pm! No queues or waiting at all. Even the baggage was super quick at coming through. Overall a very solid experience in economy.

"Not Verified | Mexico City Airport is a zoo, but taking the late departure on BA to LHR isn't too bad. Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks. We had a lovely shower at the 'spa', what a fabulous facility. The South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster. Who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess! Food on offer was solid and so are the drinks. Our home stretch to Amsterdam was pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service. I love the 'double'-servings of drinks. English tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don't understand BA stuck to it through the years. No-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey...

"✅ Trip Verified |  Very poor service, very frustrating. Firstly my flight to LHR was cancelled on 16 Mar23, while I got a text message to inform me, the information desk was unable to confirm if was correct or scam. Once this was confirmed, I went to the counter to get my new boarding pass. At the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in 15mins for the hotel. We (me and other fellow travelers) waited for over 45mins, there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions. The transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the airport. When we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30. that was a rush. It appeared more of a Motel than an hotel. The room - was smelling of weed, being a non-smoker this was uncomfortable. Although I wanted to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the sink came off in my hands, I panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room. After some discussion, they agreed to change it. I went to the alternate room, to my horror, it was occupied. I asked the staff to call a cab, and I left.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives. Not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant. The seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly, if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own, or else you are breathing in the head/ scalp of the person in front of you. Food was revolting, they don't even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre-meal drinks and the secondary meal.

Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest.

"✅ Trip Verified |  
Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option.

"✅ Trip Verified |  The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. If this is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service. A lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees I interacted with.",1,2023-03-12, United Kingdom ,True,usual shambolic unfolding ba unfortunately come known long weekend flight booked munich supposed departing th february happened first flight newborn month old daughter turned horror show incompetence hr scheduled departure original th february flight cancelled received email boarding heathrow express booked day holiday work trip ended getting round trip paddington instead way back cancelled flight wife tried calling ba despite one u silver membership possibly largest joke membership currently took u nearly minute speak someone could help believe ba outsource call centre end talking people following script result might well speaking ai rather human often received response similar computer say service level silver member imagine regular punter put phone originally connected person wait minute computer booted ba proceeded auto book u onto new flight next day going different destination original flight munich auto booked replacement flight salzburg asking robot ba call centre booked u replacement flight location km apart understand frustration eventually someone able book u onto flight following day ideal wasted valuable day work hotel refund u move booking least going munich salzburg day new flight came round time managed get way check desk upon arriving check desk told rebooked flight cancelled minute earlier email text notification ever arrived ba tell u flight cancelled incomprehensible could possibly happened check person said get app rebook point know whether explode anger cry luckily another check person ounce sympathy explained useless check person could actually rebook u booked onto another flight later evening ba unfortunately meant hr grotty lounge month old baby appears everyone access lounge really difference lounge hostel get free stuff former pleasant experience eventually arrive munich despite asking get push chair stroller delivered front plane plane characteristically ba dumping ground used give sanitising wipe could clean seat tray table seemed cut back service another shocking ba service lost day holiday ounce empathy sympathy understanding employee interacted
Not Verified |  Lost my case and took 6 weeks to locate it and still have not replied to me after 8 weeks. I had a business class flight scheduled on Dec 12 2022 … Manchester > Copenhagen -Bangkok and return flight Dec 27 2022 … Bangkok > Stockholm > Manchester. SAS Airlines left Manchester over an hour late due to the weather and air traffic control. When I arrived in Copenhagen to get the connecting flight for Bangkok we were 10 minutes too late and the flight had gone (half of the plane missed it).. SAS Airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being … Copenhagen (SAS) > London (BA) > Dubai (Emirates) > Bangkok. I returned from Copenhagen to London and the collected my boarding pass at BA. We were over 2 hours late leaving London due the weather and a passenger being asked to leave the flight. We arrived in Dubai late and was informed the flight had gone. Emirates then informed me that I had to speak with Thai Air to get another flight issued. I spent over an hour phoning Thai Air with nobody picking up the phone. I then spoke with Thai Air Dubai who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that I buy a new ticket and then claim the funds back later. I paid £1279.43 for a Kuwait Airways flight out of Dubai > Kuwaiti > Bangkok. Whilst in Dubai I checked with Kuwait Airlines regards my baggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from London and they would locate it and forward to my Bangkok address the following day.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Back in December my family and I as we were getting onto the plane were refused. Even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked 6 months in advance we were refused. It turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn't let all the passengers on the plane. So quite randomly (not) 9 people were selected and turned away. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually, it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So, again, I send them the same information that I have done before.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Outward journey BA245 London to Buenos Aires Club World 10 January 2023. Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout.

"✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was one of the worst I have ever had in my life. I wanted to pamper myself, so I bought business class. I was looking forward to my new experience. I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price.

"Not Verified |  As a Spanish born individual living in England, I have been using British Airways for over 3 decades, multiple times a year. On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned. According to BA  policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when I’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago).",3,2023-01-19, United Kingdom ,False,verified spanish born individual living england using british airway decade multiple time year th january booked flight son go alicante however informed th january doctor unable fly due elbow operation result decided give ticket daughter calling customer service team british airway make change th january took enquiry call seemed speech delay call presented small bit difficulty however also struggled understand support staff member top delay requesting change name one ticket daughter name told within policy would need cancel ticket rebook encouraged divide booking son two different booking reference number accepted asked would like cancel booking insisted would need know total refund lucky ask check informed would roughly total cost booking come per passenger leaving refund total le value purchase despite seat abandoned according ba policy entitled simple change name le refund even buying ticket right back phone probably money worth week ago

"Not Verified |  I find BA incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers. I have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although I know it sounds silly - when on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage. There was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug, when I challenged why I had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment - I was told it was a short haul fight. My sisters met me from Cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew Egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance, drinks, food and inflight entertainment as well as a USB port to charge their phones.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew ATL to LHR 8th Jan 2023. Was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777. Refit gave it a decent IFE screen and the seat looked decent. Although combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds, and any movie can be ruined. Headrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets. Toilet seats old, stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinks/snacks offered.  Meal was sent out after a couple of hours. Was poor. Chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food, mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?! Dried crackers with no cheese. Kids meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it.  Very very poor. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion, is terrible.

"Not Verified |  Great thing about British Airways A380 is the economy section upstairs. Get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very old, the A380 looked tired inside. Broken side stowage, a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFE. The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey, 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same. Asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box. Staff were ok. Couple decent but mostly just ok. Overall, BA just seems a tad cheap these days. Great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended. Just seemed a bit dull and like BA are just an average airline.

"✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height.

At checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees? Took about 5 minutes to resolve. Seat was nice enough. Stowage pocket in front a bit small. Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves.

"Not Verified |  Boarding – at gate at LGW they called Group 1 to board (we were World Traveller Plus & Group 3), then called ""anyone in Groups 2-6"", whereupon everyone else surged forward. Why have numbered boarding groups if you don’t use them. Cabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane. At one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past, and without even a word. No acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past. Service – We were in the final row of six in WT+ (which has a total of 48 seats). The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options. Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ meals. There was a second hot meal served before we landed. Again, the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left. I asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the Baby Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread, pretty basic. Drinks – They ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. We had to walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet. We flew Virgin Atlantic 2 months before in equivalent (Premium Economy) and it was so much better. Organised boarding, sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or orange in BA), food options available (even in last row seats), better food, proper glasses/cups for drinks, dedicated toilet access, help yourself snacks, helpful service from cabin crew.

"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be. The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. Overall, the airline is still a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff.

"✅ Trip Verified |  When I tried to check in online, I was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under £300. I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service.

In reality - excellent flight. Couple of days later I flew back from LHR to Prague. Boarding at LHR T5 was a total chaos. Onboard service cannot really be called service: No curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet).

✅ Trip Verified |  London to Gibraltar on 25th October 2022. I booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience.  BA attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices. Offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where BA aim to be positioned at of late. The A320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map. The staff disappeared for most of the flight.

"Not Verified |  I’ve generally been a loyal Gold status flyer with BA if they fly the route I’m after but my recent flight to Nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get. We should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally left 4.5 hours late, not ideal when you’ve then got an 8hr + flight. Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. They couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough. That was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing. I sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service. They were all extremely miserable and clearly didn’t want to be on board.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Just a few years ago flying on BA was enjoyable, but times have changed. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. Altogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making European journeys.",9,2022-10-25, United Kingdom ,True,year ago flying ba enjoyable time changed day five hour board plane fun terminal experience still feel classy way felt well staffed efficient board though become experience endured ba mean decision split seat nicer first half plane nastier rest underline entertainment magazine refreshment purchase brought seat ordering app attempt provide fresh hot food day despite competition able much ask trapped board five hour get free tiny bottle water small cereal bar outbound flight crew collected rubbish landing helpfully tied bag around toilet door back case anyone wanted fight way past clear thing recline button deleted seat seat pitch feel squeezed return flight one reason another due ba delay previous day two hour late getting plane late evening passenger travel enough crew cabin crew nonetheless distinctly professional flight altogether would say good thing hard think anything could recommend ba pity used professional company deal pleasure worth looking forward making european journey

"✅ Trip Verified |  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again.

This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come.

This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line.

"Not Verified |  Decent flight and airplane, non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight. Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. They released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the Tuesday flight they gave us. We were going to make our own travel back to the Netherlands.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris.

The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good.

"Not Verified |  Today, my husband and a friend flew from Dublin to London City Airport. All apparently went well from check-in through the flight. After that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. We waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. I found a BA service person to ""help"" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim"").

I then paid $205 to reserve two seats on our own, in a 2-4-2 configuration cabin, as I didn't want to sit in a row of 4 people if possible. A few weeks before our flight BA emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection. When I logged in to see my new seat selection I had been moved into a row of 4? The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid. I called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and I paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Departure was about 40 minutes late. The A350 we flew on was about eighteen months old. The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back, it is a real challenge to get out of the seat.

The cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service, it felt very disorganised.

"✅ Trip Verified |  BA cancelled my flight, I never got on it, couldn't book another and refunded about a quarter of what I spent despite their covid guarantees.  I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn't getting a full refund. I didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. ""Thanks for contacting us about your claim for EU compensation. We're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to Heathrow on 29 April 2022.

Not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul (LDN-JNB) is really low quality. Other airline operators which are working with Do&Co for flight catering are way better than BA. I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option from Do&Co.

"✅ Trip Verified |  This a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delays. The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. I don't know what the business class offerings from BA's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia.",1,2022-06-23, United Kingdom ,True,new route ba introduced beginning june several year covid related delay business class experience fear typical nickel dime policy introduced airline past decade plus helpful friendly fa minus cabin fairly cramped six seat across pod surprisingly little room limited storage space hard adjust seat particularly getting lie flat even fa found difficult flight entertainment limited poor choice film tv programme music food choice quality poor one three main unavailable pea mushroom risotto almost inedible cheese selection also poor know business class offering ba rival flying similar route like experience match provided singapore airline flight far east australasia
"✅ Trip Verified |  As a regular BA customer on European flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling of delays. Staff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate. Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages (I flew Turkish 10 days ago). Staff service was perfunctory, but no attempt to interact with any customers in Club Europe cabin. I end where I started, BA standards continue to slip. ",4,2022-06-22, United Kingdom ,True,regular ba customer european flight sad true note standard continue slip particularly ground service lhr atrocious handling delay staff entrance first wing brusque put mildly rude accurate flight boarded departure min later late customer allowed board single pa apology flight deck crew benefit low cost airline hang around latecomer sadly ba time warp ba pilot used best updating status dropped dramatically last year food standard choice first lounge one item improved post covid inflight service short h flight light dinner tray choice row passenger club europe salad option available printed menu offered cabin staff explained given menu customer appears supply control place ba food quality okay co supply co meal turkish airline remain superior ba manages flew turkish day ago staff service perfunctory attempt interact customer club europe cabin end started ba standard continue slip

"Not Verified |  Feels like BA are putting the 'economy' back in 'premium economy'. Very pleasant, friendly and helpful cabin crew. However it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Recent trip to Boston, departing LHR T5. Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy.

"✅ Trip Verified |  As a seasoned traveller and a loyal BA customer I am appalled at the company’s recent drop in standards. We were booked to fly from ZHR-LHR on a miles ticket in February 2022. When we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage. We were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage. We have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. As this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation. I tried contact BA Customer Services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn’t bothered to respond. At the 3rd attempt, after I cc the CEO on my complaint I got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket. At this point I got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge.

Guess what, a few weeks ago that also got cancelled. I had the chance to rebook with BA but with so many cancellations planned I was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event, so applied for and received a refund.

To request the voucher I have to sign away that I agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not get it for a week.  I am panicked so I try calling them. Of course, calling them does nothing. The hotline says that they are too busy. This happens again and again. So, I give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. Luckily it shows up quickly, and I rebook. Then I need to change my booking again. I go to request a voucher again. This time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when I enter it.

"Not Verified |  I have been battling a long overdue refund with BA regarding a flight originally booked in 2019... The flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelled. After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn't as the voucher had been used. I asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. Two years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. I then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a refund. One phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. I have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response.

"✅ Trip Verified |  When I tried to check in, they required a certificate of insurance for Covid travel, but I did not have it, I tried for over 2 hours to get it issued, but my bank (where I had the travel insurance) the department that could issue the certificate was closed, it was 18:30. After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutes. They would not let me board, and I missed the flight. So I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was BA policy. So then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. I originally paid £1500 for the flights. I then did a search on Google and found flights for £1100, flying out with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on the same flight I was originally supposed to return on. Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the Insurance document.

After about 6 hours of waiting for a Twitter DM back I ended up being able to find a chat line on their website.

Other times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plight. IF I managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after ""needing"" to put me on hold once more to ""speak with their supervisor.""

As Qantas fly to Heathrow, British Airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on BA from Heathrow to Glasgow. We booked this flight in October however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from British Airways, advising that our flight from Heathrow to Glasgow has been cancelled. To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways. They also sent the email on Good Friday so even when I did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed. I have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline I have ever flow on and I can guarantee I will never fly British Airways again.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Total chaos for departures immigration at Malaga Airport. Boarding was quick, polite welcome by cabin crew. Beverage cart after take off was prompt, followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees. Food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of Air France, Swiss or Lufthansa short haul business class meals. Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return. BA is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on Covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.

My flight to Paris was no exception. Not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked. As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris.

"✅ Trip Verified |  The short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for. We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again? No, not if I had half a chance of going with another airline.

"Not Verified |  Very poor flight from Cape Town to London. After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes.

"Not Verified |  Feb 25, 2022. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined.

"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new Club Suite, but BA59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines Club World product. The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth.

"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online.

The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming.

We had no time to eat at LHR so thought we'll get something usually around 1 hour into the flight. 3.5 hours after take off they served out food.

"✅ Trip Verified | One would think that the number of crises BA incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art. I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket.

We weren’t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight. I think the crew in Premium Economy were very young and not very experienced, leaving the experienced ones in Business/First. Actually, I think BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. They ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it’s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen.

Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware.

"✅ Trip Verified | The economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean.

"✅ Trip Verified | Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets.

"Not Verified |  Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently. My sandwich was inedible.

Not Verified | Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing! ,8,2022-01-12, United Kingdom ,False,verified past year flown british airway twice ended exact predicament wait around day london heathrow hour flight home newcastle holiday plane staff fantastic customer service staff heathrow useless first time february got stuck heathrow due storm ciara travelling home work airline fault however handling situation staff airport joke staff ran kiosk queue unhappy traveller whilst could set mini kiosk unused gate get everyone quicker crowd control one point queuing hour plus staff decided shut shop end hour battle lucky enough get home last flight day sheer luck finally spoke someone november decided give ba second chance booked go new york since plane landed late lhr missed connecting flight could avoided staff heathrow assisted held plane short rushed custom manage make gate minute spare plane still terminal since taken luggage flight told go service desk refused let since moved later flight layover hour got guest service food voucher spend phone number thought complaint hold minute found complaint considering fact could avoidable assistance given food voucher seemed really cheap day got home raised complaint expressing annoyed waited month response chasing find complaint staff working got response said wanted back holiday got apology told staff heathrow better term good compensation offered nothing
"✅ Trip Verified |  Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra?

"✅ Trip Verified |  I have flown with BA for many years and today was another poor experience as I’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service. I understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but BA’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted. Enormous queues at JFK BA check-in terminal 7. Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. Very poor. I used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like I’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days.",3,2022-01-09, United Kingdom ,True,flown ba many year today another poor experience witnessed airline decline sub par service understand tough two year airline ba decline started pandemic truly plummeted enormous queue jfk ba check terminal even priority lane standstill least half hour people started complaining miss flight terrible efficiency check counter time one member staff processing people whilst ba staff stood around phone chat one member staff stopped processing man desperately trying catch flight order start processing someone else jumped interior plane generally filthy crumb bit food stain mark around seating area give single wet wipe used think hand see passenger wiping surrounding area good courteous member staff also awful member staff behave unprofessionally particular flight one cabin crew swearing colleague back plane apparently pulling weight poor used proud ba flyer feel like clinging airline status actually provide better service day

"✅ Trip Verified |  Straightforward and friendly baggage drop. On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor. Nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used.

"Not Verified | On arrival at the Warsaw Airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board - we had to guess and ask random people where to go. Once we finally found the check-in desks, luggage drop and check-in was appalling. It took us over 1.5 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue). The whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kids. Lady in Warsaw Airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless. One check-in desk for Euro Traveller / Club Europe, one for bag drop and one for the check-in.

"✅ Trip Verified |  In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again.

"✅ Trip Verified | After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time.

When I emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with ""That's the final amount.""

"✅ Trip Verified | Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.",3,2021-12-28, United Kingdom ,True,overall lovely flight ba edinburgh christmas holiday lounge ok quite worn although staff food nice much better travelled last time although plane seemed old cabin felt fresh clean temperature perfectly adjusted liking around c funky lighting although seat economy pretty comfortable hour hop much better air france together enhanced legroom row wonderful gold card passenger ba automatically reserve row club europe enhanced legroom think great touch crew especially purser phenomenal extremely friendly adaptive need professional leaving pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering lovely short flight sandwich scone tasty actually fan well presented however simpler meal board opinion tastier give feeling trust quick hop ba ticked mark comparison cdg lhr leg air france presented chic cold starter however looked bit complicated except duck terrine rather unappetising klm served super nice simple chicken caesar paper box one big drawback first wing experience queue long decided go regular line instead quite disappointing given much money regular flyer company spend earn gold status nevertheless flight importantly crew completely negated drawback flight one way return incl transfer kirkwall pretty expensive however service seemed like worth money

"✅ Trip Verified |  It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill.",2,2021-12-02, United Kingdom ,True,future travel voucher singapore london thought would perfect flight relocate home impression simple process call book onto route previously paid previously cancelled ba new date wrong first pay top flight significant amount equivalent around value original flight redemption ticket part cash part airmiles price increase fact flying peak time extra charge also meant overall paid face value online price time ticket flight well still keeping airline redeemed explained online price redemption price differ system work however taken refund would lost lot money administration fee desperate situation losing hundred pound matter cut loss booked flight least thought call centre agent previously explained working remotely manager supervision way escalate issue took card detail including full card number date cvc code explained flight ticket receipt payment extra bag would follow week later still ticket detail charge card booking reference nothing called confirm call centre agent reached apologised advised would escalate booking team took card detail waited another week sign booked onto flight thus began cycle increasingly frequent desperate call british airway repeatedly failed simple task booking flight spanning week friday monday flight sat tear another ba call centre agent promised get flight book extra bag next day around hour due fly finally got booking reference yet still failed charge add extra bag luckily noticed check detail managed add bag online whole experience stressful costly resulted spending hour day phone listening british airway hold music furthermore significant cutback ba inflight catering service due covid resulting smaller portion leaving quite hungry long flight though flown ba repeatedly problem past service gone significantly downhill

"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways seems happy to encourage the spread of Covid. Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. Maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to Covid that now prevails in the UK.

"Not Verified |  What has happened to British Airways? The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that!

"Not Verified |  I booked and paid for what I thought was a business class seat on a flight to Athens. What I got was a premium economy seat. The first nine rows were business class seats, rows 10 to 16 were what should have been the premium economy cabin (but had been added to the business class section) which had less comfortable seats that didn’t fully recline, unlike the seats in rows 1 to 9 (I was in row 11). This is not a case of me being snobby, but simply a point of principle and a clear case of BA mis-selling. Had I known prior that I would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight, I wouldn’t have booked. I complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way. I also made a formal complaint to BA but was fobbed off.

"✅ Trip Verified | This was my first flight during the pandemic, so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines. Check-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc. But on the return flight, it was a total mess. Just two counters open for economy and one for business. There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other. It took an hour and ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delay. On board, I was not expecting great service.  Seating was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flight.  On board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another, no eye contact with me just handed out. However, I was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups, despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate.

On arrival at Heathrow to check in, the British Airways staff informed me that I had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake. I offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sister's name but British Airways refused us to board and sent us home. However, the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds. I never received these flight vouchers. I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me. They have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say I was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate. I have sent numerous emails to BA explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers. I have had no response to my emails/messages.

The latest flight was so late into Heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we’d scheduled around 2 hours between flights. BA staff at Heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part. They couldn’t get us to our destination within 24 hours of our scheduled arrival time. We booked an easyJet flight from Gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to Gatwick. A complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 ""travel flexibility"" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class ticket from New York to-and-from Mykonos through London. I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor's note saying that I was sick, then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight from Boston to Heathrow arrived in time, but I and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane.

Because of this delay, I and other passengers lost the connecting flight to Tirana. I was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. When I booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour.

"✅ Trip Verified | Year after year the British Airways (BA) service on the same route (Washington-London) is becoming worse. We just had one bad experience after another on this route in July 2021.  British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies).

"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve been flying with BA for years and never had any issues. I recently had to arrange to have surgery in Budapest and naturally wanted to fly BA. So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I usually avoid BA because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but this flight was my only option. Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route. I used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with BA's unique and notorious ""fuel surcharge"" fee of $636 for using miles.",7,2021-06-22, United States ,True,usually avoid ba appalling customer service sneaky extra charge flight option note ba actually charge seat pre selection biz class uk pound case airline world dare saved money waited checkin choose seat free seat ba universally derided cramped across back front configuration stare face seat mate arm length away airline ever came awkward arrangement wonder preflight drink offered meal time selected one three main offering told available even though people seat biz section seat area practically storage except tiny drawer ankle level inaccessible seat lie flat position bed narrowest experienced biz class also hard cabin cold blanket thin raid blanket two seat stay warm amenity kit smallest ever seen biz class fit palm hand uncomfortable miserly experience hardly worth ba charge route used mile pay ticket course got whacked ba unique notorious fuel surcharge fee using mile

"Not Verified |  I was travelling back from Mexico City on a business trip. Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment, which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment. Firstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2. There's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed to fly with Aeroflot on the 23rd of December to Moscow. But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn’t get home. I’ve also tried to fly through Antalya, but the same situation occurred. On my third try, I came to Heathrow and tried to fly away to Cairo. I was declined by another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I’m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines!

"Not Verified |  Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided, given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines. I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I have always had great flights with British Airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing! As this was my 100th flight, I decided to celebrate it in Club Europe, which turned out to be a perfect decision. The stewards working in Club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty. Although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight, other features didn’t let me down either. Efficient business class check in at Warsaw, cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for Club Europe because of Corona). The aircraft was very fresh and clean. Seats were comfortable with enough legroom, adjustable headrests and power ports. The on board service is different than before Corona times but it’s still very good. Tasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. The choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight. The plane to London was 90% or more full, and no social distancing could be applied. A number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water).  It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck.

"Not Verified |  I booked flights to Rome from the US and then home through London to LAX in February of this year for the 1st of August. I booked through American Airlines, and then I paid for seat selection for 3 people through the BA website, paying US $951 in total. With the pandemic, it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to Italy and England on this trip as (1) we are not allowed to travel outside the US, (2) as Americans we are not allowed to travel to Italy or England, and (3) the US government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early February. I had to cancel all of our hotels, AirB&Bs, car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds and/or vouchers. I’ve tried to reach British Airways customer service a number of times, finally got through today after an hour on hold. I asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that I had paid for and was told that I will lose the money I paid, that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed, because I booked the trip through American Airlines and not through British Airways. My understanding is that BA and AA have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners, though I was shocked at having to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our seats in business class, but this is apparently not the case. I was told that if BA cancels the two flights that we are booked on that I might be able to get either a voucher or a refund. I was prepared today to accept a voucher that I could use when I rebook this trip for 2021, as I understand that BA (and all airlines) are suffering financially as much as I am, but I was not prepared to be totally ripped off by BA. I cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly, August 1st, to cancel this as I will lose the money and miles I paid American Airlines for this flight.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a trip to Spain for mid-March 2020 with American Airlines, British Airways and Iberia. I needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to Europe that began in March. I was able to change my flight at no cost, which is great, but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began, those tickets should have been refunded. If I were to have boarded that flight, I would have been quarantined in Europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon re-entry to the US IF I were able to return at all. The fact that British Airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since I do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to Spain with the travel ban enforced.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew with BA recently from Sydney to London, deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation. The first ticket I booked with them was via Hong Kong. After booking, HK closed it's borders so I could no longer get this flight. I rang up BA who advised that the HK flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn't yet book me onto a new flight yet. The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and I didn't want to end up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choice. When I got back home I raised this with BA. They told me that I was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I'd never even heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say I had to do anything. So now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amount. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so. They were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don't know why I was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it.

The boarding procedure was very well organised (no chaos) with 5 groups boarding sequentially.

"✅ Trip Verified |  A journey of 2 halves. Before hand, multiple lies and lack of information from the BA website. They cancelled my flight but they weren't honest about what they had done and lied. They claimed that I could re-book and showed lots of flights - none were in fact scheduled to fly but BA claimed that they were full. Then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that ""all journeys complete"". Website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the USA to UK. Impossible to get through to BA in London. USA BA much better - a total wait of 1 hour 40 minutes to make 2 calls. Staff at the call centre efficient and helpful. Chaos at Chicago as most passengers had American issued boarding passes for the BA flight to London and BA weren't accepting those boarding passes. No explanation for the change in policy. Everyone I saw merely handed in the American boarding pass and was given a BA boarding pass. On the plane the staff were excellent - as usual. Food was good - verging on very good. Breakfast a little small but tasty. I even got a 2nd cup of tea! Journey smooth with some sleep. I stopped flying BA for 10 years because the head office is so poor - the staff on the ground are good but BA as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed: e.g. over securing client's data, telling passengers what is going on, running a decent frequent flier programme, design of the business cabin (stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo!) and so on.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to Vancouver mid March to see my mother, then in hospital. Three days after arrival my mother passed away and I subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral. I tried to manage my booking online, as BA suggest. But, because I had bought a package that included car hire the BA site said I was unable to change this online and I had to call their customer services. I spent over 19 hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed online.  I set up conversations Facebook and Twitter, they went unanswered. On the second day of my telephone ordeal I actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in ‘holidays’ who said he couldn’t help me either but that he would try and add me to the queue for the help line. When this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting I managed to blurt out my Ref number, nothing else… before that call was disconnected. Thankfully the one person I had briefly spoken to in the Duty office that night then emailed me back and I was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight. This change took about 10-15 minutes over a few emails. But the person helping me couldn’t extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected. The only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company. But two days previously, when I tried to manage my booking online I was told I couldn’t do this because I had bought a package and that this could only be done by BA.

"Not Verified |  I booked my flights to the UK in May 2019 and had to cancel our trip to the UK on March 12, 2020 .. 4 days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on March 16, 2020 and because I am older and have pre-existing health conditions, my doctor asked me to postpone our trip. The British Airways customer care associates I talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable. Now the problem is, I need to rebook and use the travel credit by May 2020 for travel to the UK by May 2021 or lose all the credit from our trip. How can I make travel arrangements by May 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? I understand BA has policies in place, but I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19. I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British Airways. British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. Whoever designed the refurbished Galleries Lounge at JNB has no understanding of acoustics, as every syllable of a Facetime conversation was audible 20 feet away. Add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience. Thankfully, the upper deck of the A380 was more civilised, with an efficient, if slightly distant, cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff, allowing plenty of time for sleep. Food was mediocre and I've given up expecting anything more from BA's business class product. The White Company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement, and breakfast has become rather perfunctory, with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient.

"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Stockholm via London. Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ‘Holiday Inn’. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn’t talk to me because I ‘failed’ security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. But old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Geneva via London. I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific's is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I'd fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Tirana. I was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. Business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. .

"Not Verified | Keflavik to London Heathrow. Cabin crew were amazing. Weather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be tough.

All the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the BA online app to help them. Non-alcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time. The first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not BA fault that the de-icing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for take-off.

"✅ Trip Verified |  The first thing is the shortage of staff. The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Brussels to Bangkok via London. Club World from London to Bangkok on 17 Nov 2019, seats 15C and 15D. It was a Boeing 777, with a 2-4-2 seat configuration in the business cabin, which gives the cabin a crowded impression. The seats are comfortable, with a flat bed (+mattress!), good selection of entertainment, although a rather small screen. The food menu offers different choices of starters, main course and desserts. The food was disappointing, I had smoked salmon as a starter, and British Beef as main course. My soup was cold, mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like. The service is very friendly, but not personal. I’m used to be adressed by my name when I fly business class.  While serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. The amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. After dinner I went to sleep. The seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. The space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. Once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. I had a real good night of sleep though. If your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. The toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough. When I woke up, breakfast service was running.  The breakfast is good.  Yoghurt, pastries, fresh fruit, and a full English Breakfast. Overall, British Airways World Club is a rather standard Business Class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience.  If BA wants to compete, they have a long way to go.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Vancouver. I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only.

"✅ Trip Verified | Tirana to London Gatwick. I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well.

"✅ Trip Verified | London to Belfast. British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘Geneva convention’ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update!

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Cape Town. We had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to Africa. I usually fly Star Alliance, but picked BA for a segment for better connection timing through London to Cape Town. This was a huge mistake. I had tried to reserve seats on BA website twice and was not able to do so. Then I tried to call BA twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option. When we arrived today in London from Toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy. BA’s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us, but we would still be welcome in the lounge, (as if this was a bonus). Then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge, since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade). It took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk. We asked to speak to a manager, but at each of our four interactions with BA staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us, giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could. At one point I got visibly frustrated after the BA staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary, which it definitely was not! After two and a half hours BA customer service managers came to speak with us. They were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective.

"Not Verified | We have had some torrid experiences with BA - which we have not been shy to report. So when we flew yesterday with them from Heathrow to Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. The staff in the upstairs business class cabin were, frankly, wonderful. Cheerful, efficient and calm. What more could you ask? The food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely. The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot think of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. Sadly, the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. Perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars!

"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Austin with British Airways. It was a little bit like going back in time to fly upper deck on a 747 to Austin. But, it was the most enjoyable flight we’ve taken for a long time. It was so quiet on our deck and we had a fantastic flight crew who couldn’t do enough for you, and always with a smile. We arrived as fresh as you can from 10 hours in the air, on time, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The only slight issue was the very IFE systems and small overhead lockers.

"Not Verified |  I did not actually fly because of their pilot strike. This review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike. I immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to Jersey, but of course, they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £110 more for a return flight. I then cancelled my BA flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 I had paid. The £28 difference was picking my seats. How do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight? They should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking. I completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me. 2 weeks ago I phoned their Customer Service line and the person I spoke to said he would refund me the £28.

"✅ Trip Verified | The start of our journey back from from EFL was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than BA. As it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. Once airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. It was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. I thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. Landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. However, BA had laid on a separate bus for CE passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later. So, not too bad, all in all.",4,2019-09-26, United Kingdom ,True,start journey back efl inauspicious hundred delayed stranded passenger crammed departure lounge awaiting flight airline ba weather uk plus air traffic control issue meant departure delayed minute airborne refitted complete nice fresh leather smell cabin crew ce friendly efficient food including cod dish quite reasonable interesting note refit extended toilet looking distinctly worse wear big plus flight first wifi actually worked quite fast although cost hour use thought meant free business class passenger evidently landing made time parked right middle nowhere backlog flight however ba laid separate bus ce passenger airport minute later bad

"✅ Trip Verified | Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault.",10,2019-09-21, United Kingdom ,True,booked flight week ba strike mistakingly thinking strike would ended two day flew fact day apprehensive would operate check security clearance took minute personally like self service bag tag drop ba operate one confident everything correctly boarding new fare group system depends much one paid ticket fan possibly due previous day strike need accommodate passenger canceled flight aircraft large boarding however smooth board virtually full cabin clean eurotraveller seat comfortable offer sufficient leg room cm knee touch seat front departure minute behind scheduled departure time flight cabin staff euro traveller cabin believe club cabin efficient friendly one wait minute take purchase refreshment full flight shame though ba gone frill line charge food drink describe full service airline landing tegel minute ahead schedule pleasant flight value good combined hotel booking tegel bit hassle border police carrying immigration control passenger end airbridge minute wait luggage ba fault

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Dublin. It was never my choice to fly with British Airways and I will never fly with them again. I was supposed to fly with American Airlines from the USA to Dublin, but I had a connecting flight from my origin city to Chicago. Unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with British Airways from London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American’s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. BA’s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city I’m in for more than a day and I can’t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. And even though their baggage claim desk was closed when I called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. Unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” Why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two years. If you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with BA. And here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. You will get a lot more information and assistance that way.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to London via Singapore with British Airways. I made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight - the food was horrendous, I was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed, overcooked potatoes (and maybe other vegetables, I am not sure) for one meal and an ice cold frittata/sandwich which should clearly have been heated up. The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course).

"Not Verified |  London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed to fly from London City to Amsterdam on 24/7, Business Class. Once at LCY, my early pm flight appeared as cancelled. A state of confusion broke out at the airport, with people trying to find alternatives, however I managed to be rebooked on a later flight. On a busy day, I waited for hours at the airport. The new flight was displayed as “delayed” for 45mins. the delay kept on increasing, with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after 10pm. I kept on waiting. The flight eventually ended up cancelled as well. Result: half a day wasted at LCY. I feel that BA’s punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately. Delays and cancellations can happen, however I have been flying BA +/- 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately, especially to/from Amsterdam and Germany.

On the day of travel, a few hours before the departure time, I realized that I would not be able to make it and so I got in touch with British Airways on Twitter advising them of my cancellation. When I arrived home, I asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund. I understood that my ticket was a non-refundable one, but it says on the ticket that surcharges, taxes and airport fees would be refundable which should have amounted to at least 250 euro. However, all the airline  refunded me was a pitiful 50 euro.

"Not Verified |  Good morning. I would like to write a review for British Airways. It took me a while to write this review as I it took me a while to get over what happened to me. But I feel that the way British Airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts. Last year I went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to New Orleans from London on the holiday of a life time. I was pregnant at the time. The baby died while I was on holiday there and I was in a turmoil of emotions. Regardless I tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on, all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in England. Somehow I missed the flight back. I have no excuse for this. When I realised I was in a complete state. I had a break down. I rang BA and sobbed down the phone. They were beyond amazing! They arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost. We all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and I was in hospital the day afterwards. Customer service was outstanding. So compassionate and helpful. And again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights. I am beyond grateful for their help.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London. The whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it.

"✅ Trip Verified | A supremely awful experience from beginning to end. Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn’t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I’ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided.

"✅ Trip Verified | Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Grenada to Gatwick. Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Barbados to Gatwick. We boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal, the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew. Once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick I had a beer and my partner a soft drink, I was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice. Within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us, I enquired what the meal was and we were both told Pasta it’s all we have left, everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt. During this service no further drinks were offered except for water, trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours. They reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake, I politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread, tea and coffee was served.  Our flight out 7 days previously was the exact opposite, pleasant staff, food standard but acceptable. The only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers, the crew turned a blind eye.

"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Glasgow via London. A routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about 45 minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal (#7). I had an electronic boarding pass on the BA app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions. There was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task. The pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. I would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them. I had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. The middle seat was unoccupied. Enough leg space and storage space overhead. A good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided. The IFE system was easy to use. A drink service preceded the meal service. I asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed IPA Brewdog Speedbird 100. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. The entree choices were chicken and pasta. I chose the later. Very basic food. Tea and coffee followed. Before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. I could not figure out what was in the sandwich! The bathroom was clean. Blankets and pillows were on every seat. Alighting was quick. Landing cards have been done away with. For the fare, I paid I was satisfied - no complaints. I connected to a domestic flight to Glasgow. The announcement of the gate was made quite late. Newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity. It was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seating. I was in an aisle seat, the next to me was empty. No complimentary food or drink on this segment. The two flight attendants, once the plane reached cruising altitude, put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs. The pilot introduced them as gorgeous. Both on this and the earlier flight, a video presentation showed off the safety instructions. It was supposed to be funny and engaging. I felt it was neither - the accents of the actors were hard to understand. The flight landed on time.

"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 2616 and 2617 return trip from Gatwick to Cagliari. Both flights on a Saturday and were full. Aircraft was an A320-200 on both legs. Sat in row 7 outbound, 2 rows behind Club Europe. Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. The brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the BMI Fleet. Didn’t bother with the new M&S On Board service outward, but did on the return. The M&S sandwich was everything you would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee I had and the tea my wife had were below standard. It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. The other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in Club Europe attending to just 10 passengers. Despite quite a lot of turbulence and the Seat Belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful. You are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to. Also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seats. The rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land. Outbound flight was fine, Inbound flight was not a great advertisement for BA.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I had some difficulty from the start, after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in, even though I was already logged in. I wanted to reserve seats and request special meals. It took me 2 days to achive this. I was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats, no extra legroom, this bumped the price up for 4 people by £328 and seats were only booked on the LHR-KUL and return KUL-LHR legs. I had difficulty checking in using the BA app and eventually did it using Malaysia Airlines app. Checking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in Kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time difference. I was looking forward to flying on the Boeing 787 but it really is just a dream. Food choices we were told ran out at breakfast, the choice was full English or just an omelette, but the full English ran out or so we were told, but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full English on it. Earlier meals were ok with beer, wine and other drinks available. There was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water. For an over 12h flight, I think the cabin should at least be visited 2-3 times. Toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Belfast City to Atlanta via London Heathrow T5. Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn't an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta's. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5.",1,2019-06-07, United States ,True,belfast city atlanta via london heathrow check fairly smooth belfast early morning however agent called check flustered elite executive club member although boyfriend checked agent without difficulty knew working premium line nobody standing standing regular line called minute finally got boarding pas go security flight bhd lhr uneventful bare bone nothing served free flight boyfriend therefore hated used getting better service american u fully aware ba turned glorified easyjet arrived lhr continued atlanta ba shocked crowded user unfriendly although suppose pretty way sit one dank cattle pit hold people flight called felt crowded hot flight called found crowded shuttle plane pushy people boarding straightforward however flight attendant polite helpful customer even economy flight product ok view exit row aisle seat extra room nice headrest seat right lav stank ife fine decent selection complete delta food bland equivalent delta serf brownie point tea service terrible given half sandwich plastic wrap without tray limited selection beverage remember year ago ba premium carrier served nice thing passenger friendly smile smile disappeared part feeling flying special carrier longer however arrived time promptly got bag also nice spacious flight attendant polite might fly though would recommend ba due crowd discomfort experienced

"✅ Trip Verified | Just checked in for a flight from Newcastle with BA. The check in process was disgusting. 45 minutes queuing. 2 BA staff working in two desks, one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from Air France in the adjacent desk! The process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes. When the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers, she seemed to take an eternity. In the 45 minutes it took us, the queue never dropped below about 100 people. I have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk. The adjacent Jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and I counted 14 staff!

The next morning (Sunday) I phoned the number again. The answer message said phone back on Monday. As I was leaving on Sunday night this was pointless. I was leaving Madrid at 8.30 pm.

✅ Trip Verified |  London to Milan. Evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty. Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overhead. Free newspapers were available in the jet way. Passengers were warmly greeted. I was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. Usual on board trolley service which I didn't use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late. Return flight could have been a challenge due to Italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding. We were taken off the aircraft and bussed into T5 which I think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control.

"✅ Trip Verified |  The connecting flight to Johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen.

"✅ Trip Verified | CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule.

We were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through security.  Only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. Service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us via texts. The delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes, just short enough to avoid compensation.

"✅ Trip Verified | I was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. During the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. I was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillow. The menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. The evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was OK served with freezing cold cutlery. Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight.

Gatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Malaga. Check in was fairly quick. The check in area at Gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. The whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. If you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. The lounge at Gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. The food and drink offering was very good. Tasty and varied. On board I was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. Food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. The food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. What was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. I wouldn’t expect this, and I’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. Still no WiFi or WiFi based in flight entertainment offered. Priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. My bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Boston to London Heathrow, was excited to experience A380 for the first time. Paid a steep $91 for the seat selection on the upper deck. Was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the Window. Seat itself was the standard one, comfortable. The boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. The inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. The food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the way midflight. The A380 being so massive easily absorbed it. Return was on a B777 - flight was not full but almost full. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The baggage drop area however was a disaster. None of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. The boarding was again very orderly.

A wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in First and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service. The young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about. Care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food. For once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent. Bedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. The IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. The goodies bag is much better and worth taking home.

"✅ Trip Verified | Washington to London. Having travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn't overly impressed. Although the Concorde Room was relaxing and comfortable, the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive.

I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Shanghai. The most disappointing business class I have flown in a long time. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Bucharest to London. My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). I applied for compensation for this delay. Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was no longer getting compensated. British Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight. However, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not. I have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy. I believe that, if not on legal basis, British Airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay (within Europe) is significant. Many times I picked to fly with British Airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong. But this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways.",1,2019-04-27, United Kingdom ,True,bucharest london flight british airway hour delayed european destination london applied compensation delay initially informed eu regulation would receive euro compensation informed day later error longer getting compensated british airway argued sickness crew member considered extraordinary circumstance comparable weather issue therefore compensate passenger flight however court precedence case clearly show crew sickness considered extraordinary circumstance airline responsibility contingency strategy case compensate talked manager customer service told nothing policy believe legal basis british airway compensated customer service reason hour delay within europe significant many time picked fly british airway based expectation good customer service case anything going wrong experience proved worth investing extra money flying british airway

BA explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seats. Additionally the BA said the flight was full and could not change the seats. No explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by BA without notice.

"✅ Trip Verified |  St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards.

Larnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm. The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, ""we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us"". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a ""balance problem"". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public.

"✅ Trip Verified |  It's been many years since I flew long haul British Airways and I was pleasantly surprised by recent flights. BA staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed. From the time of arriving at London Heathrow T5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful. Similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn't do enough for me. When I requested tomato juice with Worcester sauce, the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it. On the way back I asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get it. The seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too. The entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and TV to watch. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit mean.

London Heathrow / Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. On the way back - a ploughman's lunch, it was okay-ish. As a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US, Japan and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe? I'd make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phones/laptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6"" of leg room behind row ""1"". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And i'd probably sell it at £25 a flight more. ""Build value guys"" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap.

I insisted (this is business class after all, half full flight). 30 minutes later, she brought a tray with everything on it (G&T, first dish, main dish, and dessert).

The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were. The entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying). I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. A similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area BA might want to look into.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow. In the beginning everything went normal and smooth. Check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. After that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at Schiphol Airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. This caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. We received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. The crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. So a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. The flight was full of overseas travellers. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. We had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Tokyo to London. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good. I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew.

We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted.

"✅ Trip Verified | A380 boarding is always a nightmare, but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the pilots. Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it.

The 2-3-2 seating in the front section of Club World on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 2-4-2, but it's showing its age in contrast to other carriers. A full cabin also means queues for the two loos, although they're a lot more spacious than in First. The drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvement. The fish option for the main course was some of the best food I've had in the air. The White Company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Whatever happened to the World's Favourite Airline? Returning from Bermuda to Gatwick we were presented with a worn-out Boeing 777. My seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging off. I had to try and balance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat, it didn't work, tray ended up on the floor with drinks and food. Reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me 'I'll put it in the book'. No apology, no attempt to explain, just irritation from him. The food was awful, neither my wife or I could finish it. It also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits, and nothing to go on the salad.

"✅ Trip Verified | I understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as BOAC go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant as is humanly possible. I paid $813 to fly r/t LAX-BUH and yet they want an extra $150 to have a desirable seat. I understand if you check-in 24 hours before departure you receive a seat from those available, but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there? In my case, they assigned me a middle seat on a 787 when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign. It is baffling. The ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make - everything comes down to make every penny they can. And why am I flying BOAC? They owed me £25 from the last flight b/c the inflight entertainment system was inop for 1/2 the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve-hour flight. On top of that, their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that 15"". For normal-sized adults, it is as agonising as the rack must've been.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Bangalore return via London on BA premium economy (World Traveler Plus). I paid about 40% more for premium economy (about $600 extra) so approximately $150 per leg. Was it worth it? I'd say broadly yes, though I wouldn't want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 6-7 hours was involved. Before Boarding: Premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 (and India to US/Canada is one of those exceptions though it isn't clear if it applies for travel originating at either end). So I am not sure if I got an extra bag or not but I did use the 2 bag allowance Boarding: You board in Zone 3 after First/Business & the oneworld elites. That is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn't fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding. This means you also get off fairly quickly - which can help if you're in a hurry to get through security at Heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination. In Flight: There is a welcome drink for premium economy (champagne, juice, water depending on the departure time). There is also a hot towel service also. 787 cabin: The 787-9 has a nicely done premium economy cabin. 2-3-2 seating as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. So a somewhat wider seat. Seat pitch is also decent. These are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortable. The food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage (though not much). There is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor. There is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf. You do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades, socks and toothpaste. The seat back screen is large and easy to use. There is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy - so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2-4-2 seating in premium economy (same as club world) as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. The 777 version used on the LHR-BLR sector has a very small premium economy cabin - just 3 rows of seats. This gives it a sort of cosy feel. You do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom. Economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full - and I had the seat next to me vacant on both legs. That helped me stretch out for sure. The seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats. Food: Nothing much here. I didn't think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been. It was OK - nothing to write home about. All in all, for such a long journey, the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage. Worth it on extra long haul like US to India.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Our return journey from Sydney to London, which was approximately 22 hours in duration with a stop at Singapore airport, was faced with one major issue. We flew economy class with a two year old, whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn’t working. Having paid £723 for our two year olds ticket, you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight. Having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed. We were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical. The cabin crew gave us some First Class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was £25. They said they would contact BA customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us. By the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim, I had already received an email from BA C/S and that they would respond within 48 hours, which they did. However, all the could offered was a £20 voucher to use on another BA flight. I replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said. I also said I had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an eVoucher is worthless to me. There was no other alternative or any means of reasoning.

"✅ Trip Verified | I had flown British Airways from Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow as a part of my journey back home (Thailand) on the 12th December 2018. I arrived at Leeds Bradford 3 hours early so there wasn't a queue at the check-in counter. Check-in process took less than a minute as I already done online check-in, this means I just dropped my luggage. The staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful. I passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft. Boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (I flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand). The aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean. The seat was comfortable and had a good wing view. The only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily I was only 176m tall so this wasn't a problem). The aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpful. The captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information. As the flight departed the crew started on board service. I didn't buy anything as the food option was poor, expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards. It was one hour flight so I didn't expect the top service standard. The flight arrived at London Heathrow on time despite some traffic. Overall, the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better.",6,2018-12-30, Thailand ,True,flown british airway leeds bradford london heathrow part journey back home thailand th december arrived leeds bradford hour early queue check counter check process took le minute already done online check mean dropped luggage staff airport friendly helpful passed security control waited aircraft boarding process mess priority boarding flew economy boarding group luckily every passenger could board front rear door aircraft parked remote stand aircraft old cabin modern clean seat comfortable good wing view downside seat second last row back seat pitch short luckily tall problem aircraft delayed due slow boarding process weather condition crew friendly helpful captain always announce information whole flight let passenger know cause delay flight information flight departed crew started board service buy anything food option poor expensive paid credit card one hour flight expect top service standard flight arrived london heathrow time despite traffic overall flight service crew made flight enjoyable improve food boarding process better
"Not Verified |  Gatwick to Tenerife. This aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! G-MEDK is by far the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. I reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal. It was like sitting on concrete! I would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 I believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadful. I took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in Lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11F a little more bearable. Staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time I returned at night ten days later. I normally travel Easyjet on this route but on this occasion, I used some Avios to make the flight less expensive. Easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these BA flights. With their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, I will not use BA on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by Easyjet is, in my experience, far superior.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. I had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck. The only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night. BA has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years, and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them. The business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat, the difference is that it goes to a full bed. There is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table. As it was a late flight (10pm), the crew decided not to offer pre-dinner drinks. I ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep. Big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller). I was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew. The trays are removed when everyone else finishes, so much for getting more sleep. The crew never came back until breakfast.

Was very excited for this trip as BA has made a come back to fly to Malaysia after stopping the service for many years. I paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room. I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time.

✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight from Seattle to London in November 6th was canceled due to technical problems. After waiting at the airport for 9 hours and staying in the line for 4 hours the BA associate couldn’t find us any immediate flight. They offered us a flight that would arrive in London late November 8th. It would take us 16 hours. Since the purpose of trip was to present a paper in a conference in November 8. I would have missed my presentation by the time we would arrive. My trip was supposed to be 4 days so by the time of arrival I had to return in less than two days. They advised us to cancel the flight and promised to refund our flight tickets as well as the expenses for our accommodation since it was to late to cancel our booking. I filed a claim online based on their instruction.  The customer relation phone number is disconnected. In fact the automatic voice mail says “please don’t chase a call”! The website link they refer to for tracking the claim has an auto message that the link dose not exist. After 1.5 months stressful attempt to connect with customer relations they finally responded by email to tell me that we are not going to receive any refund from them. ,10,2018-12-23, United States ,True,flight seattle london november th canceled due technical problem waiting airport hour staying line hour ba associate find u immediate flight offered u flight would arrive london late november th would take u hour since purpose trip present paper conference november would missed presentation time would arrive trip supposed day time arrival return le two day advised u cancel flight promised refund flight ticket well expense accommodation since late cancel booking filed claim online based instruction customer relation phone number disconnected fact automatic voice mail say please chase call website link refer tracking claim auto message link dose exist month stressful attempt connect customer relation finally responded email tell going receive refund
"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Barbados. We flew out of Gatwick on the 6th December and back on the 17th Dec. It started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I'd guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st Class is holding up. There are scuff marks everywhere. Surface scratches. Bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. It's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. In the WC there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least. The motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have flown both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining. Taking one meal; it starts with an Amuse Bouche. One motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. One tomato. One bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then had jerk Chicken dish. It was just about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay. The cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. Quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. They trumpet the ""superb"" Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. £20 a bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world's most hated Business Class in the sky. I'm a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. From a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of a BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to London via Singapore. I'm hugely disappointed with the Business class trip. The seating arrangements leave little to be desired, i.e. if you are on the isle you're interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding). Service is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes. If you're next to the window, you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat. The drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive. If you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, I had two drinks slip off the Teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat. Dont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of it. After I watched two movies (on a 24 hour flight) I was scratching to find anything else decent to watch. The ""new releases"" is a contradiction in terms. There is very little priority giving to Business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy. Once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats.

"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Hannover via London. I booked on ba.com, the longer flights both ways in premium economy.  On the return I was informed at San Diego that the American Airlines flight into DFW was severely delayed and I would miss my flight into London. American Airlines could book me on a later flight the same day, but had only  coach available. If I insisted on premier economy I could fly in 3 days. I took the coach and American assured my that BA would refund the fare difference for this downgrade. After arrival at home I contacted BA on their website to refund the fare difference. A bizarre exchange followed. First they said you did not buy any upgraded seat. I told them to look at the ticket. You can't get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat. I contacted BA Germany who said you get a refund, but you booked this with a travel agent, so we are not in charge.  I booked with BA on their website. They saidthey would send this to London so they can compute the refund, but then you can't get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Johannesburg. Turning right to the first wing at T5 was a new experience for us. It was all pretty slick, although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly Mr Convivial. The Concorde Room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. Boarding involved lining up according to group. This smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but I guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. The first cabin on the A380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. The dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. The fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. Cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. Food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. The wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous LPGS, and we enjoyed some wine tasting. Sleep quality was considerably better than Club World, although the cabin temperature was a little high. Overall, an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel.",10,2018-11-27, United Kingdom ,True,london johannesburg turning right first wing new experience u pretty slick although guy check exactly mr convivial concorde room impressive particularly terrace quirky interior design overlooking main concourse boarding involved lining according group smacked bit low cost airline guess necessary passenger double decker plane first cabin definitely spacious suite also room extra storage space divider seemed higher giving better privacy fact cabin half full another bonus cabin crew friendly attentive thoroughly professional food good demonstrated airline food restaurant quality cabin crew use reheating facility properly wine offer good selection including fabulous lpgs enjoyed wine tasting sleep quality considerably better club world although cabin temperature little high overall excellent flight fully met brief first class travel
"✅ Trip Verified |  Having booked BA Business Class and paid extra for the seat selection on the Boeing 787, I was disappointed to have the flight re-scheduled. I rejected BA's offer of flying on Belgian Air and had to change my flight to get a different BA aircraft. When I booked in the window seat selections had been lost. My husband and I were forced to sit separately. At the booking in I was told that they could not find ""proof"" that I had paid for selected seats. I could not prove the payment because the booking number had changed with the new flights. Spooning with a stranger in the centre isle was not the trip I planned. On the return flight (again, sitting apart from my husband) my TV did not work. The staff could not have been nicer, but could not find an alternative seat.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to London Heathrow. I chose to fly with them because I had been told they were good for families and as I was traveling with my 8 month old alone this was what I needed.

He was too big and could not lie straight so I asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with 15 minutes.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Boston to Nairobi via London. The only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from Boston to Heathrow. The cabin crew service was below standard. I had a window seat and twice I was passed up and not offered anything to eat/drink while everyone around me was, simply because I was watching a movie. I  noticed that if you didn't have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anything. Airplane food is not exactly gourmet but BA food was so bland even the little I ate was only because I was hungry. The connecting flight from Heathrow to Nairobi was  worse because the plane was the  opposite of the one from Boston to Heathrow. It looked beat up and lacked even the basics like a USB port.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Basel to San Fransisco via Heathrow. I'm convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years. I booked World Traveller Plus or Premium Economy which costs appr. twice as much as economy. The flight to SFO was ok seat wise as the plane was an A380 and I has reserved an aisle seat. The food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. The choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. There were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. We were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay leaving the UK). The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. You couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I'm not big. The recliner didn't work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. I feel sorry for larger people.

"✅ Trip Verified | I would not recommend this airline. I travel a lot for work and get to fly different airlines so have a good base to compare it to. Baggage Allowance: Only give you 23kgs of checked baggage and if you are 1 kg over (regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under) you have to pay $170AUD extra. This is the strictest airline I have ever used. All other airlines have allowed up to 5kgs over at no charge. Ensure you have pre-weighed all bags. In-flight meal: On the way to Sydney, they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal. It is an 8 hour flight! Make sure you pack your own snacks/meal. You don't get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks. Make sure you pre-pack a bottle or two once you are through customs. Customer service: From the get go the customer service was appalling. It is hard enough traveling with kids, but having to deal with BA was stressful. They wouldn't allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and I had a slight delay which meant I couldn't go on the same flight. At the airport, they couldn't find my children's booking which caused further delay and stress. How do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking? They then put my husband in a seat not with all of us and wouldn't do anything to help change this. We had to ask the person next to my kids once on the plane on our own.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Philadelphia. I upgraded from coach to business for almost $900 because I  wanted to experience BA’s business class in the Boeing 787, but I was disappointed. While the aircraft was new, the staff really could have cared less about the business guests. 2-3-2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail. BA lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite, service wise was lacking. Pre-flight they offer you a beverage, I asked for rose champagne and I was told “I guess I have to go find a bottle and open one”. In my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours, not on this almost 8 hour flight. I was served my main meal almost 2.5 hours after takeoff. You get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing. You also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. If you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley. Yes they have the menu, linen, silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you. Because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable. There was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that’s it. I have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no Wi-Fi on this flight. You get a pillow, duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit. BA has the new planes, and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service. I will not pay to upgrade to business on BA and will avoid flying with them if I have another option.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to London Heathrow. It's my first time traveling on British Airways. The seat arrangement in its long-haul business class is very uncommon that half of the seats are facing backward. So you are face-to-face with the one sitting opposite you (at least during taking off and landing when the divider is lowered down). There are 8 Club World seats per row for 777-300ER, which is relatively narrower if comparing with other carriers serving this route. The cabin service was as good as expected.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Los Angeles. Booked this trip eight months previously and as I lost my status on BA a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats. The flight I chose was a Boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. We were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an A380 to a twenty one year old Jumbo. We were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. We were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. After a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. Reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. The seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. We have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club Europe. But with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile. We only took this trip to use up some Avios, they have all been used now and we could come back from LAX on Virgin Atlantic.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to London Heathrow. As with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with BA's customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline. My issue was with faulty equipment onboard. Issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy. Had to move seat and as first, club and premium economy all full, had to move back to economy. Asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation. Following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear BA lacks consistency and don't wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong. As i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think BA now need to work on their problem solving skills.

"Not Verified |  Calgary to Rome via London. My wife and I booked our 10th anniversary trip from Calgary to Rome return, with British Airways, Sept 17-27. This was my first trip in Europe, and we spent almost $8500 CAD on first class tickets. The flight Calgary to London (stopover) was ok. I got a bottle of water, and then nobody came to the pod I was in for the next 8 hours. One would have expected more from first class, maybe another bottle of water? They asked me to fill out what I would like for breakfast on a card. I filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came. The vacation itself was great. On the day of the return flight, our Trenitalia train broke down in Naples, and we were 80 mins late. My wife tried dozens of times to phone British Airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service. We tried the numbers from our tickets, their website, their help desk, Facebook page, Google etc. We tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get through. My wife managed to check herself in online, but could not check me in. There was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in, once my wife pressed my name, the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete. It was a computer glitch we couldn't get around.  Ultimately we arrived at the Rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in. My wife was ok and could go through but I could not. We asked the 3 ladies at the British Airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us. Apparently, they said it would have been different if we called before, and we showed them her phone (see the attached photos) with all the calls we made. They then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn't reschedule us. They gave us another number to call My wife at this point was near tears. I am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior, so I was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs. She was managing all the luggage, the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed. The attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way. The new secret customer service phone number we were given did work, and my wife was on the phone with Customer Service for over an hour. After reviewing the details with several teams of specialists, we were told basically that they didn't believe us that we tried to call, they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call. Nothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800. No apologies whatsoever were given, nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in Rome. We eventually made it home on different airlines but I have lost all respect and trust for British Airways.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Bangkok. Flew British Airways for the first time in a couple of years. Terminal 5 is rubbish. It may look great, but you have to travel further using the train services to get there, and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel  again on another train  to  T5a or b as they are again separate  sections of terminal 5. I usually fly EVA and others from Terminal 2 and I would avoid T5 if possible from now on. The aircraft interior was old and dated, the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iPhone 8+ (without the technology). The food was ok at best, served cold to warm on both meals on both flights. The crew were okay on the flight home, however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them. Landing cards for Thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in Bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at Bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag. The flight had some drunks on the way back to the UK, and while this isn’t the airlines fault, I did notice that when one young guy of about 21 was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager (he kicked off) the next crew member did serve him.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I was in Prague flying British Airways back to Heathrow. Apparently there were thunderstorms in London so the flights were being delayed. My 17:15 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morning. There was no British Airways person at the Prague airport to relay this message: some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the 8 am flight. The sheet of information didn't offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to get back into Prague. This consolidator also mentioned that there was a 20:00 flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight. So after calling British Airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening, I went  online and booked the flight. Because of the late timing, I was charged $356USD. Then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone, I finally learned that BA would only reimburse me the non-used flight that I had booked 3 months earlier- at a cost of $96 USD. They also said they would send me a $50 flight voucher: not sure how many months it will take until I receive it. Is there any other airline that doesn't simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them?

On the KUL-LHR leg, the aircraft was clean and spacious in the PY cabin. The seats were the biggest let down. Whilst there was adequate legroom, they were hard and uncomfortable, especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support. The headrest did not move at all. The seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide, there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which I think is a missed opportunity by BA to maximise utilisation of space. The food was okay, you get two meals, the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke. IFE was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Brindisi to London. Flying from any airport that includes Ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad sign. Brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for Club Europe passengers. There was also no priority check-in, or, indeed, priority anything. Boarding was a fiasco, with two lines directed into pens, pending the mad dash to the plane, which then entailed using a rather weird, tiered set of steps that was just another queue. Service in Club Europe commenced efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the breezy, cheery type who'd have been better suited to Ryanair. The brief drinks service over, it was on to the the much-vaunted, new look Club Europe meal service. Sadly, this proved to be just another cost-cutting, exercise, with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once, and the appetiser and cheese 'courses' reduced to microscopic portions in little pots. And, of course, the seats haven't changed, although, interestingly, BA seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the Club Europe section, which means that the service is little different to the old economy. Still, we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes. It's just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and un-business-like.",1,2018-09-17, United Kingdom ,True,brindisi london flying airport includes ryanair among serving airline bad sign brindisi airport least modern make concession comfort certainly lounge club europe passenger also priority check indeed priority anything boarding fiasco two line directed pen pending mad dash plane entailed using rather weird tiered set step another queue service club europe commenced efficiently cabin crew breezy cheery type better suited ryanair brief drink service much vaunted new look club europe meal service sadly proved another cost cutting exercise everything piled tiny plastic tray appetiser cheese course reduced microscopic portion little pot course seat changed although interestingly ba seem intent packing ever passenger club europe section mean service little different old economy still arrived minute behind schedule priority tag result bag coming belt within minute whole inflight experience lacklustre un business like

"✅ Trip Verified |  Rome to Newark via London. The first sector was on a A319. Flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time. Boarding at FCO was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups 1 and 2. Flight attendants friendly and welcoming. Seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight. There was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased - even water. No entertainment either. Was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the M&S menu. Connection at T5 was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon. Boarding for the flight to Newark was organised and painless. I was dreading this 787 flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped. Happy to say, the seat comfort was pretty good, legroom was manageable. I was however surprised that for a 2 year old aircraft (i checked), it was pretty dirty. There was grime around the USB port (which didn't work), tv screen and along the floor by the wall. The cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well. I found the touchscreen IFE to be outdated and slightly slow in response. The selection was not as extensive but I did find some excellent British content that I had not seen before. The real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly, professional and warm they were with their service. They were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick. The main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing.

"Not Verified |  London Heathrow to Dubai. This was the first time I had flown in first class  on BA. I had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed. BA's first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isn't the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates. We were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the BA fleet. The cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious. The sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy. It is nice they offer a male and female kit, my wife was delighted with the contents. The Champagne that BA offer in first is superb. I enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne I have tasted. Choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the Johnnie Walker Blue Label if you are a whiskey drinker. Food was very tasty and well presented. I had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then Lamb Machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille. We were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing. I cant really fault any of it. It was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too. IFE was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing,. I believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787. I do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice. The thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew. From the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous. Attentive with out being over-bearing.

"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Madrid to London Heathrow. The 767 is ancient and BA have clearly given up on hiding that fact, I guess they will be phasing these old but great planes out of service soon. I love flying in 767s, the configurations are generally very comfortable but to be honest the plane was really dated and BA should definitely improve this. Aside from this the flight was really very good indeed. BA Business class has in my experience always been consistent, consistently good. BA cabin crew in Business class are a real asset. This was one of BA's more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphere.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Washington to Frankfurt via London. Check-In at Dulles Airport was smooth. I asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did, even though at the online check-in there was none available. Boeing 747-400 was 27 years old, the IFE was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly bad. The seats were ok, pretty standard but they had a head rest which was good. My seat was 27A and I had the whole row for myself. Unfortunately a crew member shortly before take-off told me that another passenger had issues with his IFE and they would replace him on 27C. Shortly after take-off the service began. There were 2 food options available. Chicken and vegatarian lasagne, I went for the Lasagne which was ok, nothing special. It came with a salad, a bread bun and a black forest cake. All in all an ok meal, nothing to complain about. The crew distributed 2 mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying. After dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep. I tried to watch some movies (the selection was ok) which was hard on this miniature IFE. In the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle. Connecting in Heathrow is pretty easy (in T5) there are signs everywhere!

"✅ Trip Verified | London to Athens. Since I started using BA in 2011, I can only say that the quality becomes worse. The leg room in Business Class in A320 is the same like in economy. The only thing that you get is an empty middle seat. The meal choices are poor: I had to choose between curry and fish pie. Also, they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 5-10 mins (once we ate the starter), they took the starter plate and they gave us the main. The on board service, is less 'attentive' than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable). Also, due to the plane being late, the cabin was not cleaned properly. At some point we need to think why would someone choose BA over low cost airlines. Tickets are priced in a similar way, there is no food on board for the economy (while for business the portion and variety are a joke), leg space is small, there are always delays to depart from Heathrow (not BAs fault, but at the end of the day I experience delays).

"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Singapore. Had a great experience in the Concorde Room, and Galleries First lounges in Heathrow T5. I was warmly greeted by a member of the crew, who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around, all because I expressed a slight interest, and for that I am thankful. The flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit. The seat was very well presented, there was a small amenity kit, as well as a pair of pyjamas. The seat was clean with pillows, as well as ample storage space. You get a closet to hang clothes, a little compartment next to the seat, as well as the overhead bin, so I never ran out of room. The pre-departure beverage was a choice of water, orange juice, or champagne and hot towels were handed out. The flight left slightly behind schedule, but at Heathrow, this is something you expect. Very soon after take-off, the crew began serving dinner. I had already booked my meal in advance, but the choice of starters, mains and deserts, as well as the beverage menu, was very good. The meal I had was exceptionally tasty and I would have it again! Once dinner service had finished, the crew turned down the bed for me, whilst I went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided. The bed was very comfortable and at just over 6 feet tall, I did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out. There were plenty of blankets and pillows available and I slept very well. When I awoke, I was offered coffee and a short while later, breakfast. The breakfast choices were continental, or cooked. I opted for the cooked option and I was not disappointed, as it was very tasty, and there was a lot of it. The inflight entertainment was good, and there was a large range of films, TV programmes/series, audio books, and kids programmes to choose from. The system was responsive and was good quality, although I did not watch any films, so I cannot speak of the sound quality. The crew served with a smile and even when I asked for a Latte, which the machine didn’t do, the crew went out of their way to make one for me which was very nice.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Philadelphia to London. Nice plane, nice seats, low quality service on the plane. Both my husband and I ordered low sodium meals. His was delivered, mine was not. When asked, the attendant brought an uncovered tray with the sticker on the tray LSML. Obviously heated up quickly but was lukewarm, dry and I was troubled by the fact it was delivered with no foil covering the food. Not the same as my husbands meal, so I have to take the airlines word LSML that it was low sodium. Attendants serving coffee missed us and when I pressed the call button it was over 15 minutes before a flight attendant showed up. One pass through the cabin for drinks. After that, you had to go to the back of the plane to find an attendant and order a drink. Sandwich served before landing in the evening was horrendous. Hummus, limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced tomatoes made this stale sandwich unappealing and tasteless to say the least. I expected edible food and better, more friendly service with this airline. Our flight attendant was stone faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to LHR and LGW to Toronto return in WT+. Finally, BA has moved back into it’s own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture. However, Premium Plaza still staff and operate the lounge. Food was ok – but the drinks choices remain poor. Slick boarding and a full PE cabin on a 777. Water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights TO London. (apparently 3 are loaded in London for the O/W leg but none for the return.) Friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. Fast bar service followed by Veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul. salty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables. The salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice. Pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross. Got a couple of hours sleep. However the IFE froze after take off due to the PA system remaining locked on and preventing the IFE from working. A reset halfway through the flight worked, though two loud renditions of Delibe’s “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up. The standard T&Cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing. I continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is. (BA should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) After leaving Toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at Heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. For the return leg, I took the seasonal LGW to Toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. An upgrade to Club World was a pleasant surprise. Fast check in at LGW but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane. Gatwick Airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with BA Fast track customers. Excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. Efficient boarding and a great reception from the Gatwick cabin crew. A fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. The Gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from Heathrow – more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. Fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old Biz food service. Overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. Plenty of wine and drinks along with T&C. After a pleasant 3 hour nap, I woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. At the gate early and fast bags too. This club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. So new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. I hope Gatwick catches up so BA don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of Biz service with LGW being the poor relative. On the O/W leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. The food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as BA really lag behind Air Canada on this route with premium economy. I do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat.

"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to London Heathrow on the lower deck of the A380 - a very quiet smooth flight. Did not want to pay the usual BA extortionate seat pre-reservation fees but still got seats together. After the real scrum at the departure gate - no apparent order, struggle to get through to Priority Lane, announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable, if narrow, seats. Of course the usual BA Club Class ""scramble over the legs"" to get to the aisle and 8 abreast - not really a premium product in today's competitive Business Class World. Welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive FA. OK meal - beef - with decent wines to accompany. Much more up to date touch screen AVOD system but still a dreadful choice of ""blockbuster"" films. Very extensive choice for breakfast - continental and cooked if you wanted it. Really very good FA's - made you feel welcome. Landed on time but baggage, for some reason, took about 3/4 hour to get to the belt. As usual I have mixed feelings about BA - if we are lucky enough to fly Club/Business Class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to pre-reserve seat.

"✅ Trip Verified | This was a night flight New York JFK to London, so it was difficult to assess the service onboard, although what I experienced was certainly not bad. I think this was a very quiet flight, judging from the number of people around the gate, and there were only another 4-5 pax in First. But it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the Concorde Room and First cabin. The former felt very exclusive but, as commented elsewhere, to the point of being fussy. It's irritating that they don't have any showers in the Concorde Room; I wasn't amused to check in at the Galleries (business) Lounge, be brusquely sent on to Concorde, only to have to return to Galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm, early August in NYC - of course I needed a shower!). Departures from NY were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather, and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway. But we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff, and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - and very welcome - top-ups of champagne, seved by various members of the crew. Likewise, all the perks of first class were there; I was addressed by name, the crew introduced themselves individually, dinner and drinks orders were taken, etc. All very courteous and professional. After such a long delay, I decided to have some more dinner as I was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine, and was served promptly, so there was still plenty of time for sleep. But the soup was cold, and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class. Moreover, it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the BA arrivals lounge at LHR would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had I known this, I would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane. A very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in T5 arrivals toilets...perhaps you saw me?). The cabin layout and bed: well, it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online. But it's certainly nothing special for First Class. Overall, a very acceptable flight, but I felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight Atlantic crossing (where can I have a shower in the morning? Where will I be having breakfast?). I've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Amman to London. Appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service. We are strict vegans so pre-booked vegan meals for our flight. Meals were delivered as usual, and had the vegan slip on them, but as I was about to start eating I noticed that I had been given butter - this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal. When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in it. I had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs). It turns out that the so called 'vegan meal' had milk and egg in it. Needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals. Shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said ""oh I don't think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk"". I had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. When she returned she said 'We don't provide that sort of thing."" That was strange, because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did. So we had no meals, no hot drinks, and our video screen did not work. The Customer Service that followed from was more appalling, they could not care less, it took ages to get replies and when i did I was just palmed off. After several months of having to write emails I was informed that I had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper, which was just another way of getting rid of us. So we did this, after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation - basically the value of the meals that we could not eat - in vouchers.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Paphos to London Gatwick in Club Europe. We had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed, as were many other flights, due to bad weather the previous evening in UK. We checked in on time, only to be advised that there was no lounge available for Club Europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay! Whilst we appreciate that there may not be a BA lounge it is normal that BA would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class. We were offered a €10 voucher each, due to the delayed flight!! Paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with BA, that no lounge access was available. The flight itself was OK, although two hours late. The cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable, my wife chose the chilli con carne and I chose the roasted chicken, both were a little dry. On arrival at Gatwick at 01-00 we were through passport control quickly and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered, again very poor show.

We expected the lounge to be busy but there was plenty of free seats. The flight boarded slightly late but we were not long in the take off queue. We are used the BA's Club Europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable. Service from the cabin crew was good. It is nice that BA have gone away from the miniature bottles of wine in Club Europe and now serve by the glass.

The seat was spacious and even with an occupied neighbour seat, I would have had enough space to feel very comfortable. However, Lufthansa on the A380 (also Y+) gives a bit more personal space (at least it seems to me). The seat recline was good as well as the ife system (big screen, wide choice of programs of which I chose to listen to some BBC concerts). The crew didn't impress me but was very friendly and helpful. The food was extraordinarily good (the chicken I had was very delicious) with sufficient food (cheese, salad, dessert). The frittata on breakfast wasn't good, however. I didn't like that they sealed the drinks 40 minutes before the arrival (a bit early).

"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew a now ageing B777 flight BA 0053 to Seattle. Pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main meal. OK choice of wine / beer with meal and greeted with glass of Prosecco when boarded. Comfortable seat BUT it's the old bug bear - 8 across with ""over the legs"" access to the aisle. Fortunately we were in the last row so my wife was in the window seat with direct aisle access. And we could look at each other and not at a total stranger. I know BA are saying that they are introducing direct aisle access for everyone in Club Class but this can't come soon enough - and 8 abreast is not exactly a Premium Product in the present circumstances, is it? Absolutely terrible In Flight Entertainment system - although it was On Demand the aircraft was fitted with a very ancient system: blurry, old screens, awful audio (take your own noise reducing headphones) and a pretty dreadful choice of movies.... FA's great welcoming and gave good service. But the main drawback with BA is their insistence that, having paid for a premium service, we then have to pay handsomely again to pre-reserve our seats (up to £105 per seat per journey!).  Not what I expect from a flag carrier airline. We refuse to pay this extortionate sum - our choices have been noted on the loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got seats together so far. So, although we had quite a pleasant flight to Seattle with BA in Club, if Virgin Atlantic fly the same route we will choose their Upper Class over Clubworld - we can still reserve our seats for free with them.",7,2018-07-30, United Kingdom ,True,flew ageing b flight ba seattle pleasant flight actually quite decent fillet steak main meal ok choice wine beer meal greeted glass prosecco boarded comfortable seat old bug bear across leg access aisle fortunately last row wife window seat direct aisle access could look total stranger know ba saying introducing direct aisle access everyone club class come soon enough abreast exactly premium product present circumstance absolutely terrible flight entertainment system although demand aircraft fitted ancient system blurry old screen awful audio take noise reducing headphone pretty dreadful choice movie fa great welcoming gave good service main drawback ba insistence paid premium service pay handsomely pre reserve seat per seat per journey expect flag carrier airline refuse pay extortionate sum choice noted loyalty card scheme fortunately got seat together far although quite pleasant flight seattle ba club virgin atlantic fly route choose upper class clubworld still reserve seat free
"✅ Trip Verified | Flew London Gatwick to Tirana Rinas. Bag drop at Gatwick was basically seamless, and BA was offering to check in your hand baggage for free. The flight was at 8:10 and the gate was supposed to be shown at 7:24 am, which was oddly specific, but as we got closer to that time, that just got more and more delayed. Until we finally got our gate info at around 7:45. For which boarding had already started. Boarding was pretty much seamless. The cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was nice. The legroom was alright, perfectly fine for a 2 and and a half hour flight. Good recline aswell. I don’t understand why British Airways opted for buy on board, their free food offering before was perfectly fine. Although the food offering was just a few sandwiches which were quite expensive. And there was no real hot food options, just a few of their sandwiches could be served hot. Flights were on time. Flights cost around £320 return per person, which was quite pricey considering the cheapest option was around half the price.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Amsterdam. BA's service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years, but tonight's experience really takes the biscuit. I should now be in Amsterdam - however, I am still writing this from London despite spending over 4 hours on a plane to nowhere. We boarded just about on time, around 1930, only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so. Shortly after, we were told that the routes north of LHR were shut, and no planes were taking off. About an hour into the ordeal, we were told that the airspace had reopened, but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot. One more hour in, we were told airspace was shut again. After 3 hours, good news! - or so we thought - we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so later. We did then leave the gate, and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway. We were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that AMS would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived, so our flight wad cancelled. We taxied back to the gate, where we waited a further 10-15 minutes for ground staff to become available. I must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal, the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat, and the cabin crew were very good. The crew gave us the in-flight service (minus alcohol) so we were well fed and watered. This is the full extent of my praise though. Little was I to know that the real disaster was still to come. BA's ground handling was attrocious. We were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings. However, BA had cancelled around 7 flights, and the queues were very lengthy. Vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because ""all the rooms were full"". I have never heard anything like it. This is beyond unbelievable. No assistance for children, elderly, and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers, as is the norm in this situation. Further, the promised ""rebooking"" staff had all gone home - I was told to consult the BA app the following morning. BA's app has rebooked my flights - two days later, when my trip was for three days total. The feature on the app to select a different date for my flights, so I can replan my trip for another weekend, is broken. I guess I'll be trying out their call centre in the morning. This is all simply appalling. We all understand that adverse weather happens. But to keep us on a plane for 4+ hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on. Moreover, BA surely know the opening hours of their destination airports. Why they could not have prioritised the AMS flight over flights to 24-hour airports I do not know. And as for the ground handling, I have never had an experience this bad. BA staff themselves were thin on the ground - they left most of the work to Heathrow staff, who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the ""we don't work for BA excuse"". I've had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review, because they genuinely couldn't have handled it better. By contrast, I don't see how BA could have handled this worse. They really are indistinguishable from the budget airlines these days, save for the good lounges if you fly business.",1,2018-07-28, United Kingdom ,True,london amsterdam ba service gone notably downhill past couple year tonight experience really take biscuit amsterdam however still writing london despite spending hour plane nowhere boarded time around told due weather would delay hour shortly told route north lhr shut plane taking hour ordeal told airspace reopened would minute wait slot one hour told airspace shut hour good news thought move around minute later leave gate given safety briefing taxied runway stopped halfway taxiway told am would shut due night flight restriction time would arrived flight wad cancelled taxied back gate waited minute ground staff become available must say quarter odd ordeal pilot informative tried stay upbeat cabin crew good crew gave u flight service minus alcohol well fed watered full extent praise though little know real disaster still come ba ground handling attrocious told head departure hotel voucher rebookings however ba cancelled around flight queue lengthy voucher handed sleep floor hotel ballroom room full never heard anything like beyond unbelievable assistance child elderly preferential treatment connecting passenger premium passenger norm situation promised rebooking staff gone home told consult ba app following morning ba app rebooked flight two day later trip three day total feature app select different date flight replan trip another weekend broken guess trying call centre morning simply appalling understand adverse weather happens keep u plane hour knew boarding would delay moreover ba surely know opening hour destination airport could prioritised am flight flight hour airport know ground handling never experience bad ba staff thin ground left work heathrow staff admittedly tried best hid behind work ba excuse cancelled flight yet still wrote airline involved glowing review genuinely handled better contrast see ba could handled worse really indistinguishable budget airline day save good lounge fly business

"✅ Trip Verified |  Faro to Gatwick. Club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at Faro. BA now do have use of a 3rd party lounge here, which sadly is absolutely awful! It feels like an average office canteen, with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there. It’s really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc. Considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport, it’s a pathetic offering. Food was minimal and basic, drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates available. Whilst BA do provide priority boarding, they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this. Once on board, I have similar comments to my outbound flight.. in my opinion they should provide a better welcome, a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off. Overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight, although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier.. at one point I dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone else’s seat. I was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all, instead just looking mildly annoyed that I was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it.

The new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and BA staff are finally enforcing the priority system.. long may it continue! On board was the usual club Europe offering.. which while not exactly luxury is standard for Europe now and for a 3 hour flight is fine. BA don’t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete, there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind.. it’s a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier. I would also like to see menus handed out before take off, which could be done at the same time as a welcome.

When caught by the gate keeper, they were told, 'Not Yet'. Some attempted to board prematurely more than once. On the second attempt, the staff told them to wait.

✅ Trip Verified |  Munich to London Heathrow with British Airways.

The check-in agent was very professional and reassuring towards me and entered into banter very willingly. He was professional and pleasant and very efficient too. The flight was on an A320 and boarding was managed well and the staff well presented too. The cabin crew were welcoming and orderly. Although there was a delay it was managed well and the cabin crew explained matters as the flight progressed. I bought an overpriced tea and felt very comfortable.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to London. Having read many negative reviews about British Airways I boarded my flight fully expecting to have a bad experience, but ended up feeling completely satisfied with all aspects of the flight. It is all too easy to glamourise the old days but in its seeming decline British Airways is no different to other European airlines. As a resident of the Netherlands I hear Dutch people saying exactly the same about KLM, their national airline, and french friends say the same about Air France. The onboard service was efficient and friendly, if a little lacking in charm. The food was more than adequate. The in-flight entertainment was adequate too. I'm not sure if the extra one pays for Economy Plus is really worth it in terms of better food, but if space and the quietness that comes with a smaller cabin matters, then it is worth it. When we landed at Heathrow, a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for 40 minutes before someone could be found to operate the bridge to let us off. Those people with connecting flights were naturally beginning to panic, but the crew handled the situation admirably.

Right from the start the check in girl on business told us the flight was closed which was a load of rubbish 1 hour and 10 minutes before the flight.

My wife now very stressed and I arrive at the finger and when we could see that everyone was still there I asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense. My wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress. The guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long way. The cabin layout has 7 seats across whereas all the other 787's I have been on have 6. That means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very, very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by. Of course the 787 is a great aircraft. So for me the seat was below my expectation. I was also amazed that I had to pay £190 to reserve seats, I don't pay anything with other airlines.

Poor food, average drinks and an indifferent staff do not compare with LH facilities in FRA or MUC. There is no ground assistance, and boarding was haphazard. Fine Cornish champagne was offered and happily quaffed. The seat was OK, but not in the same class as the new AC J class pods, and not close to the Emirate's suites.

✅ Trip Verified | I have flown British Airways numerous times over many years. Sadly the experience has deteriorated significantly recently and this flight was particularly poor. The staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be there. The person next to me and I asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left - too little had apparently been loaded. There was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice. We asked for the fish. After some delay we were given our meals but found we had both been given a vegetarian meal. I had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice - no apology. Eventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyable. We were asked for breakfast choices and gave in cards which stated we wanted a light choice 40 minutes before landing. We were not given anything. The service was really poor - and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlines.

Breakfast (a light refreshment including juice, tea and coffee) consisted of a cream cheese roll, and oat biscuit, and half a cup of warm tea some 30 minutes later.

Flight left close to on time. Service was quick as we were first served at the back. We were given pretzels and drinks first then dinner was about an hour later, which was vegetarian pasta for me. Adequate amount of food served and was tasty. Ice cream and juice/water was served halfway through the flight. We then received a snack before landing which was a sandwich and a toblerone. It was ok. Return flight from Vegas was on a old 747. Horrible old seats with no padding and very dirty. Service was a lot slower as they announced they had less staff. Less drinks served, again food was ok chicken curry this time. Small snack of a egg tortilla yoghurt and muffin served for breakfast. IFE was horrendous on the old 747 tiny grainy screen with a very limited choice.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew on a last minute emergency trip London Heathrow to Baltimore with BA. Most disappointing feature on this roundtrip was the aircraft the new Boeing 787. I found the aircraft too small and cramped for transatlantic routes, in its 3-3-3 seating configuration, despite the crews in flight service and the inflight entertainment being of a generally average economy standard, the aircraft lacked the legroom and seating comfort of the other aircraft I have flown on other transatlantic routes, 777, 767, A340 and 747. BA needs to remove many seats from this aircraft in economy class, also the cabin air temperature was awful and humid, with no individual regulation.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Earlier this year, my wife and I travelled business class with BA from Dublin to Jo'burg, returning from Cape Town, thru London in each direction. Having paid business class fares, we were then quite taken aback to have to pay an additional €476 for seat selection on the long haul sectors. Had we not selected seats, we could have found ourselves not just separated, but possibly with one of us on the upper deck and one on the lower deck of the A380 on the way out and the 747 on the return flight. We therefore had no choice. What sort of customer retention policy is this? No other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection, but BA just don't seem to care. It is a rip-off. The forward/rear facing business class seat plan on BA planes is really unattractive, complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat. BA should take a look at the Emirates A380 if they want to see a customer friendly layout. This was our first business class experience with BA.

"Not Verified |  Los Angeles to London. I booked with AA, LAX to LHR round trip very far in advance. BA is AA partner. Paid for the BA seat selection early to get good seats. BA canceled the flights (coming and going), BA did not inform AA or me that the flights were canceled. All of my text and phone number was entered with BA with my passport number. They should have contacted me. I found out a couple days before my flight because I happened to call to do a meal request. It turns out that BA shifted to smaller planes and I actually spent six hours, over two days trying to get flights on the days I needed to catch up with a tour. All they said is we can't help you. I kept calling and calling and got seats on the days I needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed, Premium Economy was awful. Food was terrible. We had pre paid $276 to choose seats. There were no good seats left. We ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets. Which meant the smell, people are bumping into you, the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours. Same seats coming home. I would have been better off flying in coach. I have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection. I tried to get this before my return flight started because I was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refunds.They wouldn't refund. After returning, I made five phone calls and spent 30 mins filling out a detailed request online. Called again today, was disconnected twice and told there is nothing I could do. It is possible I may get a response in a month regarding my email request. Don't ever fly with them! They used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service. If you have a problem, you will be up a famous creek without a paddle.

BA’s Galleries lounge at CPT is adequate but let down by a poor food selection (including packaged cheese and biscuits, with flimsy wooden knives) and limited wine choices. Champagne was conspicuously lacking. Toilet paper wasn’t being refreshed in the toilets and here was no lock on one of the cubicle doors. There were no information screens, so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board. Boarding itself was efficient, with priority for groups 1 and 2. Seats 62J/K on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job, and at least there's plenty of storage space in the window bins. Take off was on schedule. FAs went through the motions, with little enthusiasm. The food was the worst we've ever experienced in Club World. The 'smoked chicken salad' was atrocious and the 'scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap' deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors.

"✅ Trip Verified | I took the new option of the new Toronto to London Gatwick which debuted this summer as a seasonal route. Cheaper than the Heathrow service, it was an interesting experiment in whether I could fall back in love with Gatwick. Excellent check in at Pearson as usual, but spoiled by the third party lounge. Goodness knows what BA were thinking, given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food options. The Premium Plaza lounge is cheap and nasty. On time boarding on a near empty flight (too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up). The cabin was a third full. Juice and water offered. No Prosecco in Premium Economy though the crew member couldn't explain why it's not offered to London, but why Champagne in Biz is manageable. On time departure, and a fast drinks service. This is my first experience of Gatwick crew. Fast, sociable, less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving Heathrow. (and all over 25!) The meal was vile - overcooked, salty and dry. As the plane was empty, I went back to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats. Awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landing. IFE on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at Christmas! An early arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flight. Returning, I liked the biz / first class check in area at LGW - fast and friendly. The lounge at Gatwick was streets ahead of Heathrow. Self serve Champagne and loads of seats. Kept very clean and plenty of food. An upgrade to biz was nice on a full flight. Efficient boarding and a fast coat / drink and menu service. A really fast bar service only 20 mins in, with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from Heathrow. The only thing that spoilt it was off duty BA staff in Biz, chatting (and distracting) the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying. An early arrival into Toronto finished a near perfect flight, The Gatwick 777s are old - very old with no power in Premium Economy.

✅ Trip Verified |  This is the first time I have flown BA's Club Europe flying from London Heathrow to Corfu. I was not expecting a great deal having read a lot of less than positive reviews online however I was very pleasantly surprised. Shortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a bag of nuts and a choice of magazine to read. Not long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a 4 course meal which was very tasty. I had cured salon followed by chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and a small cheese plate. We were then offered a choice of hot drinks and a top up of champagne. The crew were very attentive and helpful. They had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past. The seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fine. This flight was an upgrade using Avios and I would happily do it again.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Our original flight was cancelled as my wife and I were just disembarking from a cruise ship. We were then advised shortly after by SMS that we had been automatically re-booked on a flight the next day, to London Heathrow. This was not a lot of good when our car was parked at Gatwick. I managed to get through to BA and was given a new booking to Gatwick also the following day. We were offered no other assistance by the airline. The following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late. Having eventually boarded the aircraft, we stayed at the gate for about 45 minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at Barcelona airport. Shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours, so we would be given water. This was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice, so no water was served. The real horror of this flight, however, was British Airways new food service, whereby passengers buy food and pay by card/Avios. This simply does not work. After one hour in the air, the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin. Eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley. About 20 minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps (potato chips). He returned to tell us he had no crisps and only one can, which we duly shared between us. Having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours, this was the only refreshment we could obtain. I consider this to be completely unacceptable. If this is the level of service we can now expect from British Airways, there is no point traveling with them.

The flight attendant who served the section where I was seated couldn't have cared less. No greetings when passengers boarded the plane, no offer of help. He asked for my drink order but never delivered the drink. No second drink was offered.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Washington to Bucharest return via London. I was originally booked in World Traveller Plus but at Dulles check-in was offered a Club World upgrade at just $499 more which I accepted - resulting flight was very comfortable with good food and top-drawer service. The two London-Bucharest sectors both went well. But all this was just a prelude to my return trip. While in Bucharest I sustained a fall and although I wasn't seriously hurt it was still difficult to walk long distances especially with heavy luggage. At the Bucharest airport bag drop the agent noticed my situation and offered assistance, which I accepted - and was promptly wheeled through security, passport control and the (very long) corridors to the gate, then put aboard the plane. On arrival in London I was met by more assistance to whisk me through the vastness of T5 and onto the plane, this time with the pleasant surprise of another Club World upgrade (this time for free). Once on the plane back to Washington the cabin crew couldn't do enough for me, checking how I was doing, going through meal choices (the menu this time round was a bit heavy on cheese and other dairy items I really can't eat but ultimately I still ate well), getting me drinks, and more. They were as professional and proactive a crew as I've ever experienced in 40 years of long-haul travel. Finally, once arrived at Dulles more assistance was waiting, right up to getting my cab. What could have been an ordeal on this return trip was turned into as relaxing and satisfying a travel experience as can be imagined - through the years I've had mostly excellent experiences with BA cabin crews and that's a big reason why I've stayed with BA all these years and will continue to do so.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Cape Town. Flying first class with British Airways is a hit-or-miss affair. But having secured a couple of return flights to Cape Town with Avios, our expectations were running high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking. Unfortunately, Terminal 3 isn't the best starting point and Galleries First lacks glamour - or decent champagnes. The food on offer is adequate, although hardly first class. Hoping for better on board, we didn't use the sit down menu. Boarding was on time and according to BA's new group allocation. Our seats - 2K and 3K - were a first for us, as we've previously gone for pairs in the centre. But seats A and K are definitely superior, with more storage space and better privacy. However, there's no escaping the fact that the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane, particularly when one inspects the shabby state of fittings in the toilets and galley. The IFE is also showing its age and badly in need of an upgrade. But at least it didn't require rebooting on our flight. Cabin crew in first were the usual mixed bag. The FA looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong job. Food was better than usual, although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait 30 minutes for our hot breakfast.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Hamburg. Typically if I fly BA it is SFO or LAX to LHR. This time I flew them from Miami via Tampa thru LHR to Hamburg. Using their Avios points I secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because BA charges you fees and surcharges to use those points at $500 per direction. Their Miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to American as they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosks plus share the American premium class (not) lounge. All the american processed slices of cheese and bologna you can eat with free booze is not what I call a premium lounge. The BA gate in the dreadful E terminal is not even on the main floor but downstairs. People jammed up to the entry points for boarding which creates a mess of boarding people by sections. Boarding was like a cattle call. BA flies one of its oldest B747 into Miami and it showed even in first. The seats were of the older design and it appeared the carpet was recent but the cabin smelled of moldy carpet. The service and food was surprisingly good compared to their service out of California. The flight was late leaving and late arriving, and this Miami flight does not dock in terminal 5. Rather terminal 3 and requiring its passengers to take shuttle buses to the other terminals which is what I did for my connection to Hamburg. In the end I decided I was done with BA because their service model for premium passengers has  hit rock bottom. Their Avios program is nearly worthless on any premium class booking or on its partner airlines.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to London Heathrow. Desperately poor service from British Airways in Club Class. Business Class is utterly outdated, with the weird ""facing each-other configuration"", and narrow / uncomfortable seats. The food served was appalling. The cabin crew were inattentive at best, and appeared disinterested in providing genuine customer service. The problem with British Airways now in First and Business Class, is what they are completely lacking: namely, any class or manners whatsoever. Poor food, uncomfortable seats, terrible / small movie screens, No WIFI and an overall budget airline experience. British Airways even charge for seat selection too, which adds insult to injury.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Mahon. Booked 9 months ago flights for first family holiday for 2 years for 2 adults, 2 children and 1 infant in lap (almost £1k for all of us. Pre-booked seats at the same time. I was rather surprised when I got an email two weeks out saying “about your flight to Madrid on the 26th May” when I was flying direct Heathrow to Menorca. Airline assured me everything was fine. Further concern when self-service check-in opened 24 hours out, wife and daughters checked in fine, me and my son were referred to airport check-in (despite all being on the same booking). An urgent call to BA I was told 1) I was probably being moved to a bassinet position. When I pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2) infants can’t check in online which I now understand is also incorrect. My concern was well placed. At BA T5 bag drop, check in agent looked flustered, a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes. Only after I checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre-booked seats were gone, my son and I had no seats at all and were standby, and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin (16 rows apart). ‘Prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know!’ After kicking up a huge fuss (I believe they can’t legally sit children below a certain age away from parents?) the check-in manager offered me no explanation other than full flights, but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight. Fast forward to the gate – utter carnage including the check-in supervisor (who cant have been more than 22) in tears. When I eventually got seen I was finally given a seat number for me and my son, again many rows apart from the rest of my family. As this was my sons first ever flight, I was absolutely livid that we couldn’t sit anywhere near each other. Added to that, my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding, kids needing toilet etc. I put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness. We boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore & holding my son I get to my assigned seat and someone is in it. Asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat. Cue BA staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes. Such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff, I even heard one of them mutter ‘check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight’! Fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that we’re going to have to get off here and my children in tears. Much checking of iPads and a BA staff member is then found (there were quite a few on the flight apparently) and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight (what seat?). Raised a formal complaint and was told that they 'understand my frustration' which is nice. Separate complaint raised to CAA about a pushing back with passengers including an infant with no seat.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew BA from Heraklion to Gatwick. I bought exit row seats for me and 3 others to sit together with extra leg room. I paid around £150 for that in January. We got to the airport 2 hours before departure, queued to check in and was told that 2 of the seats were reallocated to someone else. I asked why. The BA rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed. She then said we should have got there earlier. She wouldn't call BA customer service when I showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch. I was told to email BA and ask them to refund me the seat cost. The flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of plane.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Outbound from LHR to Washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in Economy all in all wasn't a bad experience, modern looking cabin with excellent IFE system, food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive, was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to Premium Economy. Return flight BA 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight, but no worries could relax in the PE cabin, boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed, how old was the plane? The cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days, a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadn't had the refurbishment treatment. Leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the IFE system that decided not to work, mind you the screen was so small and scratched I doubt I would have been able to watch anything. Cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days, it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with, after a few words from the Captain we departed. The evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok, wine and G&T was acceptable, about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should I say offered some sort of filled roll. I declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered. I should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special, for having spent an extra £400 for the upgrade.

"✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to London. This was the second part of my Sydney to London trip and looked forward to it as it was on a BA A380. Now this aircraft, in Qantas colours, is one I am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with QF. As mentioned in my review of BA16 (which was the first leg of this trip) it is the on board soft product that is the problem. The same comments for that review apply here. The IFE is a work of mystery in terms of content. On Qantas, American, Cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies, great music choices. Those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning (Godfather, Gladiator, Brave-heart, Roman Holiday etc) are all things we as passengers want to see. Some smart edgy team in Soho, London pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. IFE is one thing on long haul. The other is food and beverage. The food quality was just substandard and something I read about constantly. On Qantas (say QF1 from Singapore to London) one gets the evening meal service, followed by Weiss ice cream, a Lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. At the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found, chocolates, banana bread, cheese and biscuits. You would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered. BA need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between. The A380 is a flagship aircraft and on Qantas it is treated as such. I am a Qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes. Put the smartest, best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember. The BA crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls. One guy looked like Steptoe (for those who remember) and was a miserable. Flying on an A380 should be an experience and I enjoy all my trips on that aircraft. BA have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. That is sad given the stature of BA. I came back on BA31 from London to Hong Kong and the same comments apply.

"✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to London via Singapore. It has been a very long time since I was on a long haul with BA of more than 9 hours. Last year had a relative sprint from London to JFK and before that in 2002. The years have not been kind to BA. Probably a mixture of the decline of BA and the emergence of other airlines. Nearly all my long haul is with Qantas on its A380, occasionally Emirates on its version and then once in a while with Cathay Pacific and American Airlines. The problem is not the hard product. A B777 or the A380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame. The B777 from Sydney to Singapore was fine. Nosier than the A380 but that is well known. Very comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call Sydney home. It is the soft product that is lacking. Check in was fine and despite being in Economy had an express pass through security (being a Gold FF with Qantas). Boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into Singapore. Now its just a lack of polish with the soft product. No menu given showing what was to be served (as with Cathay, Emirates and Qantas). The cutlery was really cheap and I mean cheap. KFC offers a better grade of plastic. I know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at BA needs to check out the plastic used on Cathay and Qantas). The food itself was very bland; a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty. Qantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert. It's just the quality that is lacking. Drinks? I have a tradition, something silly, about starting a journey off with a Jack Daniels and Coke. This is available on Qantas but no sir, we don't serve that. A note about the FA's: they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver. Final word about this leg is the iFE. A touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically bad. Award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 years. One or two interesting things and some new releases. Come on BA, for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics. As for music: well I'm 53 but still like the Pearl Jams etc of the world. We are not all into Brit Pop and edgy music presenters. If BA is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills, the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline.

I remember them as not a ""top of the line"" airline, but better than average. This time it seemed that any nice things have been dropped (hot towels as you neared your destination), and they have become almost a low fare airline. You pay for reserving seats, on shorter flights you pay for food, etc. The seating on the Boeing 787 seemed very cramped. It is said to be 31"" but seemed like less. On the return flight on May 3rd, two of the lavatories went out of service. The A320 from London to Prague seemed to have more seat room, but the seats were very hard. They may be the new ""slimline"" seats, I'm not sure, but they were very uncomfortable even for a two hour flight. Also, on the Washington  to LHR flight we had printed out boarding passes at home. The agent at Washington printed out additional ones and said we should use them, but when we got to security she had printed out two for me and none for my wife.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Montreal. I did my online check-in the night before and left to go to the airport. I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours in advance, went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass, and the kiosk wasn't working, so I proceeded to the BA counter to get my pass and check in my luggage. I was in line for approximately 15 minutes when we were all told to switch lines. The line we were moved to was substantially longer however I was patient. By the time I got to the desk, an hour had passed, and I had a bit over an hour left to my flight. I figured this was tight but all the while manageable since I trusted BA's system. The woman at the counter asked me where I was going and when I said Montreal, she looked at me and said ""you won't make it"". I explained the situation how I had been in the airport for several hours already and that I was in line for 1 hour. She just told me I needed to go to the missed flight counter. I got to the counter and they informed me that I had to buy a new return ticket. My original return ticket cost me $800, my return cost me $1350.  I had no choice but to buy the ticket. I also had to stay in a hotel and then take a bus to Gatwick airport the following morning. Once I arrived back in Montreal I called BA Customer Services and they told me that it was protocol to put me on standby and not make me purchase a new ticket, and that I could get a refund, if not for the new flight, then for the $400 of the flight I missed.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Tokyo to Amsterdam via London. On the evening before departure I received an email from BA the flight would be delayed for one hour but we were urged to get to the airport on the original time in case there wouldn't be a delay. In the end the aircraft left Tokyo Haneda with a 90 minutes delay. Baggage drop off was smooth and was handled with Japanese politeness. If you have the choice to fly from NRT or HND I would definitely choose HND because it's much more conveniently located to downtown Tokyo. The aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were bussed to the aircraft, adding more time to the delay we already had. I didn't like the seats on the 777. I found them quite uncomfortable and the legroom was insufficient, especially when you have an instant recline type passenger in front of you. On the window and aisle seats, there's also the IFE box so there's no place for both feet. The meal was a joke and there was no choise. Inflight entertainment is not up to date, small screens with low brightness. The crew was not very friendly. When I went to the galley for a drink I was was urged to return to my seat instead of drinking in the galley and stretching my legs. The second meal service was rushed. We've got our meals and after 5 minutes the crew returned to pick up the trays because we were already descending to LHR.  Luckily I've made it to my connecting flight to Amsterdam because I had a short connection. The A320 flight to Amsterdam departed ahead of schedule.

✅ Trip Verified | Check-in at Vienna Airport was painless. BA uses Air Lounge at Vienna and was adequate with enough seating and food was okay. Boarding was a scrum as there was no priority given to Club Europe passengers. The flight wasn’t full therefore service was quite prompt. I found the crew to be quite engaging and friendly and were happy to talk to. The food was quite mediocre which consisted of afternoon tea scones and miniscule sandwiches.

"✅ Trip Verified | Took a day trip to Vienna with British Airways, booked at the last minute. Flying out at 0720 on a Sunday and having an early start to get to the airport I was looking forward to getting some sleep on the flight. Having never usually been a problem, I boarded the aircraft and asked if it would be possible to get a pillow and blanket, to be told by a member of crew that these are not for economy passengers – only business. Freezing temperature onboard the aircraft, so managed to get limited sleep – another example of BA’s pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates the non-existence of customer service within the airline. Despite it being one of the first flights out of Heathrow, with no queue for departure and perfect weather conditions – we still managed to arrive about 20 minutes late into Vienna – quite as to how, is beyond me.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to London Heathrow. I was dubious about flying BA especially after my last flight over a year ago - after which I left the aircraft feeling very hungry. However my trip to USA with BA was surprisingly very good both ways. On this flight, after deciding not to spend on an upgrade, I was pleasantly surprised by being given a seat with extra leg room - didn't feel the need to get up and stretch my legs once. Although I slept a lot of the way, the cabin crew were very helpful - even asking the captain to find the direction of Mecca so I could pray (in my seat). Was given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee - i had to ask for both, but was given without any fuss. A380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent, although I noticed a funny (not that loud) motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey.

The BA Club World cabin is very cramped when compared with Cathay. The seat configuration is ok if you want to chat to your wife or friend but there is very little room to store items and just feels very cramped. The duvets and blankets come in a bag that is in the seat area, which the crew insist on putting in the overhead lockers for take off, this is fare enough but there is little room. They also provide bottle of water, which is great, but again little storage area. The food service was also disappointing, the duck breast as my main course was very tough.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to London Heathrow return.  Outbound First Class, return Club World. A380 both sectors, awesome aircraft. Firstly, BA flight deck crews are awesome. Totally professional and you know that they are tremendous pilots.  The cabin crew on both sectors were polite, friendly and professional. Their service was excellent. I wasn’t feeling well on the out bound flight and I didn’t eat anything, so I can’t comment on the food. On the return flight, in Club World, the food was very good, no complaints there. The seats were comfortable although the Club World cabin felt cramped. I was in 53K which is a window rear facing bulk head seat. As it was a daytime flight, the noise coming from the galley didn’t bother me, but I think it would be an issue on night flights. I hope BA change their business class seating for something like AA business class on their 777-300s. BA business class is really dated, and I said it felt cramped. My BIG issue, and this isn’t entirely BA’s fault was the over zealous security screening at Heathrow. I was pulled aside for screening 3 times. I don’t mind extensive, in depth security but to be screened 3 times was excessive.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Dallas. The aircraft was old no sign of refurbishment for the last 10 years or so. Seat pocket was full of rubbish from previous flight. The personal screen is tiny and no longer responsive as a touch screen, so I had to use the remote control which is fixed on the armrest and non retractable. The choice of IFE is very limited. The food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portion. I saw some passengers request for more food, and I was glad to see the crew giving out nicely without attitude. I must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional, whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights to/from JFK. I had an onward connecting flight with American Airlines, and I can clearly see the changes between the 2 airlines over the past few years. Whilst AA is improving, BA is becoming a national embarrassment. BA remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes to seat selection. The seat selection price tag just makes the total cost higher than other decent airlines. It no longer deserves a 4-star rating, but edging between 2 or 3 star.

"✅ Trip Verified | BA used to be a byword for quality and service. You simply can’t say that anymore and the only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the ticket price. I paid 600 dollars for my ticket from Istanbul to London with BA. For that price there is no airbridge (you will wait on a crowded bus) and no entertainment (note: this is a 4 hour flight. Also, screen devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight, so no alternative of watching movies on your iPad). Oh and you’ll have to buy any food and drinks on board. I flew BA on this route because no other flight time worked for me, however Turkish Airlines is by far the better option, with airbridge, free hot meals and a modern entertainment system.

"✅ Trip Verified | Premium economy worse than most airlines economy. Unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats, foot rest but no leg rest, very little seat recline and difficult to operate. Rubbish food, very poor landing and everything went flying. Additionally, we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people. These “premium economy” seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos. Other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light - not BA. Even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup. This was the second leg on a flight from Sydney (via LAX) so we were beyond tired. When an attendant picked up my son’s water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight, he didn’t hear my son say “thanks” (which he had) so the attendant said pointedly “You’re welcome - rude!” and laughed about it with the passenger next to him. In my experience, better (and cheaper) premium economy can be found with Norwegian, Air New Zealand and American Airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge.

✅ Trip Verified | Naples to Gatwick. The online check-in would not work for me in accordance with the One World Frequent flyer policy. I am a Qantas frequent flyer and so I ought to have had the chance to check-in a few days ahead of the flight. The BA website would not let me do so. The bag-drop in Naples was slow and seemed rather random. Boarding was tedious. I should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card. In the mean time other passengers were allowed through the boarding gate which proved to be misleading as a transfer bus was needed. Boarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggage. The cabin crew were quite indifferent. I greeted 2 cabin crew when I boarded and neither of them smiled back. I bought a Marks and Spencer drink at an inflated price. One of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when I went to collect my bag it has been ripped by the luggage of another passenger.

The food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink, even in Business (I flew out Club and returned Economy plus). Staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude, no changes there. Boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. Service is not exclusive anymore. Seats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLub. Their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food allergies/intolerances) really bad and of poor quality. It is a shame Singapore Airlines doesn't fly to Brazil from the UK as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. BA has become mean, greedy and indifferent to their customers and I feel it is time for the CEO to go as he is ruining the image of the airline. The changes on baggage weight has become silly also. I was allowed two luggages of 23kg. Any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as I haven't go above the allowance I am entitled. Instead I had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14. In my opinion unnecessary as I had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg! So I will in future re-think my trips to Brazil. Even if I have to make my journey longer as I am after good service, value for money and a differentiated experience.

"✅ Trip Verified | I traveled on British Airways with my wife from Dallas to Lagos, Nigeria via London on February 23, 2018. I had an extra bag that I paid $200 for in Dallas, our flight got delayed in Dallas, therefore we missed our flight to Lagos. When we got to London, we went to the BA counter to explain our situation and find a solution and they decided to put us on a Virgin Atlantic flight to Lagos. On getting to Virgin Atlantic counter, we were told that we have to pay for the bag again and request for a refund from BA, we decided to do that. I opened a case on BA website, explaining what happened and requested for a refund, as what happened was their fault and not mine. They refused to issue the refund claiming that each airline has their own baggage policy, I know this, but what happened was not my fault, but theirs. That was the last time I heard from them on the issue, even the economy premium was a waste of money, nothing special, such a disappointment, never again!",3,2018-04-12, Nigeria ,True,traveled british airway wife dallas lagos nigeria via london february extra bag paid dallas flight got delayed dallas therefore missed flight lagos got london went ba counter explain situation find solution decided put u virgin atlantic flight lagos getting virgin atlantic counter told pay bag request refund ba decided opened case ba website explaining happened requested refund happened fault mine refused issue refund claiming airline baggage policy know happened fault last time heard issue even economy premium waste money nothing special disappointment never
"✅ Trip Verified | Flew British Airways from Budapest to London Heathrow. Quite possibly the worst flight I have ever had (and I travel often). Generally when we travel, we try to pack our hand baggage light, as we check our heavier bags and it's more convenient for other passengers too. My partner and I had 2 briefcase-sized bags between us that fit nicely in the overhead locker. As more passengers boarded, most with as-large-as-possible carryons, the overhead lockers filled up. The flight attendant walks up to the overhead locker above our heads, takes out our bags, hands them to us and says ""I'm sorry but the space is needed for large bags"", telling us to put them underneath the seat in front of us. Reducing our leg room to zero. How is this at all fair? I questioned why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carry-ons, and was given the response that I would delay the flight if the bags had to be offloaded. I have no idea who at BA thought it would be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean ""thank you for bringing smaller carry-ons than everyone else, as a measure of our appreciation, we'll take away your leg room"". The general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mention. Young adults barely out of high school, and who would be more suited to making coffees in a road services Starbucks, such was their experience at providing pleasant service. What a sad state of affairs. I will never ever travel British Airways willingly again, long haul or short haul. I would rather take a civilised one-stop journey with Lufthansa and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the persistent dirty feeling of a direct British Airways flight.",1,2018-04-10, United Kingdom ,True,flew british airway budapest london heathrow quite possibly worst flight ever travel often generally travel try pack hand baggage light check heavier bag convenient passenger partner briefcase sized bag u fit nicely overhead locker passenger boarded large possible carryons overhead locker filled flight attendant walk overhead locker head take bag hand u say sorry space needed large bag telling u put underneath seat front u reducing leg room zero fair questioned lose leg room result smaller carry ons given response would delay flight bag offloaded idea ba thought would good policy hand yellow tag mean thank bringing smaller carry ons everyone else measure appreciation take away leg room general decorum flight attendant also deserves mention young adult barely high school would suited making coffee road service starbucks experience providing pleasant service sad state affair never ever travel british airway willingly long haul short haul would rather take civilised one stop journey lufthansa arrive pleasant frame mind endure persistent dirty feeling direct british airway flight
"✅ Trip Verified | The air conditioning didn’t work in the part of the airplane where we were sitting and it was very hot. I had to stand in the back of the airplane where it was cooler. It was an 8 hours flight from London Heathrow to New York JFK. Overall the airplane was old with little space to seat. There was no wi-fi. The leg/seating space was very small. I wish that food would be more taste neutral. If your child doesn’t like spicy or flavored foods/snacks, there would be nothing to eat. The stewardesses were most helpful and their service was outstanding. Landing was smooth. The BA staff made us to check in our bags even they were carry on.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My bag was damaged on a BA flight in December 2017. All looked good when I got to the airport customer services counter - was told it would be replaced and they gave me a number to call. I called this number when home and it's a 3rd party company called K2. They will only replace with a poor quality bag that is not the same as the one they damaged despite it being in excellent condition and hardly used. I raised this with BA who refused to offer like-for-like replacement. I got nowhere with them after hours on hold numerous times. 4 months later I decide that something is better than nothing and call K2, to get the bag they offered me, only to find that BA have closed my case and they won't send one. Finally get through to BA and they finally agree to put me back to K2 to get the bag offered. If I want to upgrade what they offer I will have to pay it myself.

"✅ Trip Verified | Efficient check in helpful staff advised on best lounge option for our flight. Decided to opt for premium economy as only 4 hour flight from London Heathrow to Cairo.

Well presented aircraft, staff in premium economy cabin offered welcome drink. Slightly delayed departure time made up en route. Unable to order main course for meal on line but got choice of meal which was totally acceptable. Efficient staff and good inflight entertainment. Happy with whole experience.

"✅ Trip Verified |  St Lucia to Gatwick. As this was a night flight we decided to fly business so we might get some sleep and I now wish we'd saved the extra that it cost, a complete waste of money. The cabin is very dated, and cramped, it wasn't clean (half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic bags on the floor) and the service and food were average at best. Why in this day and age do BA persist with having seats with no direct aisle access? Not that I could get comfortable enough to sleep anyway, the seat was adequate and no more, the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky, needing very firm contact to get any response. On top of this there was no USB point to charge my phone! I expected better cabin service than we got, not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it - I certainly don't expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested 15 minutes earlier.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Fort Lauderdale to Gatwick. An efficient courtesy bus took us from car rentals (terminal 1) to the international terminal (terminal 4). Check-in was friendly. Security staff insisted on using a whole-body scanner for everyone and were overly officious. Surprisingly, there was no business class lounge, although there was plenty of sitting space before the gates in the redeveloped terminal. Boarding was according to group rather than priority which caused some annoyance. Club World was in two smaller cabins, with the usual, outdated eight seats abreast. Take-off was on time. The wrong menus had been loaded, so the actual menu was announced over the tannoy. Drinks and food service served efficiently. Food adequate and not overcooked, but below the standard of Turkish Airlines. Seats hard and uncomfortable for sleeping, with the usual issue of having to climb over legs if in a window seat.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to London Heathrow. It's bad that BA requests additional payment to select seats before the check-in. If flying solo it's not a big issue, but with any companion (in this case I was with my son of 10) it would have been an issue to be separate. This also means that if there are 3 or 4 flights, and a group of two (as in my case) the difference would be substantial, up to approx 1000$. Lucky enough at least on the return flight we were able to select the middle seats because the flight wasn't full. On board service was decent. Professional, courteous and friendly attendants.

"✅ Trip Verified | London to Las Vegas. Disappointed at BA - flights were delayed (my partner took the same outbound flight on a different day and was delayed as well by 2-3hrs). Aircraft interior was outdated, unclean and uncomfortable seats with very small legroom space. No safety video which was surprising as most long haul flights include this. Food was tasteless and I did skip a meal in the end - during one of the snack times we weren't given the options by our FA but the guy sat next to us who was served by another FA was given different options. Inflight entertainment poor with very limited choices and monitors were very old. To ensure that I sit with my partner on the return flight, we paid to reserve our seats - not impressed by this especially when we realised that the legroom space for my partner was obstructed by a broke IFE box which was loosely fitted so the door kept opening taking his legroom space as well as exposing the cables in the box which if you knocked it down would affect his monitor.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Muscat first class. First time trying out first class on BA. Check-in was fairly quick and efficient, didn't have much luggage, but the first wing did not feel very exclusive. I had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as I got printed boarding pass. Concorde room was nice, well designed but quite crowded in some places. Had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace, before it got served a good 20 minutes later. Checkout out the cabana for an hour, which was not very appealing at all, and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment I booked for the Spa. Onboard was informed there was a problem with the Seat I had selected, and was issued a new aisle seat, which was disappointing. Upon entering the first class cabin, I had a quick look at the seat, and it was not immediately apparent, there was something wrong. I asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that I will indeed not be able to sit there, but there was no explanation of what was wrong given. I did not want to waste any time to settle in, the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read. Seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private, with a small wardrobe to hang jacket. The TV screen seemed quite large and high quality. Unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive, and neither was the remote for the TV. Soon after take off, I was informed I could eat when I like. Arabic starter was great. Had pre-selected main meal online. Meal was of good quality and cooked well. Had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate (not as good as other cheese I've had in some Business class). Surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection, I imagine on two ultra-long flights in the same month, one might run out of anything of interest to watch. After finishing the one film I decided to watch, I decided to try get some sleep. Crew made the bedding while I tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom. Bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough. I missed breakfast, as I was still rather full from the dinner and pre-dinner at the lounge. Overall, I was reasonably happy with the flight and the product. The crew were very friendly and professional. Given this was first class, have to admit there was no wow factor, either with the soft product or ground experience.

"✅ Trip Verified | London to Casablanca. Their customer service quality in Heathrow Terminal 3 is very patchy. For background, my initial flight was with TAP Portugal which got cancelled, then rebooked to BA. My second flight had further issue, and instead of requesting TAP to rebook me, BA took the liberty of rebooking a 3rd flight for me - which turned out to be overbooked. This then caused me having to liaise with both TAP and BA to rebook my 4th flight - I was tossed around by both customer care telling me it's not their problem. TAP can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as BA rebooked me on the 3rd flight.

During the dinner, I was sleeping so you could say that it was my fault for not staying awake.

Instead of them explaining and apologising, I had to ask where is my food. They said that they ran out of food, because they only cater for 80% of the passengers assuming some will be asleep. The cabin crew were very nice, he apologised and passed me a feedback form which I have filled in. While I understand that this airline does not want to waste food (and I liked their act of putting an envelope for you to donate to kids in need), it is not very nice when you are a passenger who receives no food for 13 hours. Also, it was also my first time seeing the cabin luggage space be occupied by the luggage of a cabin crew (I thought they should have their own?).

✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to London. The worst long haul carrier I have flown with. A very disappointing experience starting with the booking & customer service department who failed to adhere to their price promise policy. The flights served the worst food. The Boeing 777 I flew on was very dated and had power outlets for charging phones & portable devices. The seats were uncomfortable for such a long haul flight and due to the lack of leg room you could feed the knees of the passenger behind pushing into my back for the duration of the journey. Meals were very spread out leaving passengers with no meals or snacks for 8+ hours. When i mentioned to the onboard staff I was hungry I was informed there are no snacks available and a meal would be served shortly before landing. Staff overall were uninterested and unhelpful.

"✅ Trip Verified | Flew short haul business class with British Airways, Manchester - Gothenburg via London Heathrow. It's a diffcult one to review, some aspects of the travel were excellent and others unacceptable. We used points to travel, so what we paid was fine, though would never pay a full BA business short haul fee. We have family in Sweden so took 70kgs (gifts etc) of luggage with us for our four night trip. Check-in was fine both ends, all fights on-time (just about) and no luggage issues, a positive. The staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively encouraged to email/publish our concerns. We had a mixture of fortunes with the catering MAN-LHR, nice cold meat platter (30 min flight). LHR-GOT three dried up finger sandwiches, no alternative offered, were told could not take from the M&S menu in economy either. One reason for this, because we ordered an asian veg meal once years ago and apparently this stays on the system. I was told to change my profile details on BA site - once home I looked it clearly says meal options - none, i.e. no special menu (confusing to say the least). Thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights. We were told in economy you had to purchase everything, even water, however if in an emergency tap water could be provided - so much for a full-service airline! Any newspapers also gone from business class. On LHR-GOT route there was no divide put up between business and economy, so a 'free for all' to the front toilet. Leg room not great, even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat (more than 24h) in advance (£21 for the frist row and £18 for the rest), which is ridiculous if you had paid £400 return. Lounges OK - preferred MAN to LHR (which is busy and looking worn already). The down-scaling of BA and the mix of pretending to be a full-service airline, but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on.

As for the BA flights, I found the cabin staff to be polite and friendly and the food to be decent, served on china plates covered with napkins. Since I was awake most of the time, flight attendants checked multiple times (outside of meal hours) if they could get me anything. My only issue with meals is, on the HYD-LHR leg, lunch was served very late. It was almost 8-9 hours between breakfast & lunch. That kind of seems their standard practice: they serve food sometime after take-off and before landing. Toilets were maintained well in all 3 flights. However, I wasn't impressed by the seats in BA flights. I found them to be a bit narrow and not comfortable enough to sleep in because I also couldn't rest my neck flat down (which I could in the AA flight from LHR -> Philadelphia). I also think it was a bit difficult for folks in window seats to move out by crossing over the passengers in isle seats, if they were old or not agile enough. The AA flight from LHR -> Philadelphia had Bose noise canceling headphones, while the BA flights had just regular ones.

✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Hyderabad via London. I had a really bad experience with British Airways. I had been planning for the trip whole year and wanted to try British Airways instead of taking my regular Emirates. The flight got cancelled just couple of hours before the take-off. The customer care was unresponsive. I have waited in the customer care call queue for hours and hours for multiple times. I had to go book Emirates in the last moment with $400 hike in price. I wrote email to customer care. It has taken so much time to get a response from them. The bad part is they won’t refund your ticket price. I hope no one goes through such similar issue. My honest opinion: Be sure of your travel plans before you book British Airways. I was my first and last journey.

"✅ Trip Verified | I had booked business class with my friend as this particular trip was planned to mark a significant milestone in my life, my 50th birthday. On this occasion, I had invested in an upgrade and as such I expected nothing less. For 15 hours on an overnight flight I had to sit in economy whilst my colleague was in business class. I was downgraded as BA overbook their flight by 10%. Their offer of compensation was £200! I am also waiting almost one month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class. This experience has caused undue stress and at this point I am reluctant to use their services in the future. Their dismissive response completely contradicts their consumer promise and values: “Meeting the rising expectations of our customers remains central to our strategy of transforming British Airways into the world's leading global premium airline.

Flight boarded on time, but twenty minutes before departure the pilot announced that take off would be delayed as luggage was still to be loaded, and engineers were working to replace a pin.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Lisbon via Heathrow. We booked our flight tickets directly on BA site since July 2017 for the travelling date of December 24, 2017. One day before our travel, we processed the online check-in and were surprised to find out that our names have been removed from our first leg of the flight (BKK > LHR) without prior notice through any communication channels (email, sms text) by BA. After many attempts to find a solution, it unfortunately turned out that we could not contact any representative office in Thailand. However, we managed to talk to the customer services team in UK. She informed us that due to the connecting flight from LHR to LIS was cancelled by BA, the airline had removed our names from the entire trip (2 sectors). The assistant informed us that it was possible for our names to be added back to the BKK > LHR flight if we (by ourselves) could find a connecting flight from LHR to LIS. The only solution is either this as explain or to accept a refund of our tickets. Unfortunately, there were no flight available on that day and that left us with only one choice - to accept the refund to our tickets (without offering any other help). Our intention is to seek for proper explanation from BA in regards to how is it possible that there is no official communication/notification in regards to the flight being canceled to the passengers. We had to figure out the situation ourselves after an attempt to check-in online 24 hours before the flight. If we had went to check-in counter directly on our departure date, we would be without a solution and our whole trip might be cancelled.  We were in a roller coaster of emotions over the issue since we had less than 24 hours to find alternative solution from a problem that was not caused by us but BA's neglect in providing proper communication to the passengers. Finally, we left no choice but to book last minute tickets from another airline which we had to pay 66% extra since it was a last minute ticket on Christmas eve. I find it inexcusable for a world-class airline to neglect last minute communication to guests on one of the most important day & holiday of the entire year. This event had caused us not only an extra charge in our entire trip's spending, but left us with one of the worst flying experiences.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Tobago. Many years since I've flown in BA club class. Interested to see if all the bad reviews are justified. Outbound flight to Tobago on 1 January was delayed 2 hours because cleaners hadn't turned up. Floor around seat not vacuumed properly. Looked for flight attendant to see if my jacket could be hung up. FA took jacket from me and stuffed it into overhead locker. Invited over PA system to read High Life magazine - not in seat pocket - had to ask. Pre-flight drinks served ok. When asked for meal choice, options didn't correspond with what was on menu. Asked FA if I had wrong menu. FA insisted it was right menu. Looked again and FA said it was wrong menu and brought correct one. Meal ok: fillet of beef took a bit of sawing but tasty. Seat was comfortable, if snug. Ying/yang seat layout makes it hard for FAs to see if you have empty cups etc to clear away on your meal tray unless you're in an aisle seat. Meal tray not horizontal. Didn't bother to watch movie as screen quality poor. Flight had caught up a bit on arrival at Antigua for stopover but was delayed a further 4 hours by need to replace faulty oil indicator. Arrived Tobago 5 hrs late. Return overnight flight left Tobago on time. Old school FAs on board - attentive, capable, unobtrusive. Don't think BA trains them like that any more. Meal tray came with dessert already on it I hadn't selected. When converted to bed, seat is good for length but cramped widthwise so you can't bend your legs, as I do, in sleep. Got a couple of hrs sleep lying on my back. Seems fairly common for FAs on other airlines to come through occasionally during the night asking, if you're obviously awake, if they can get you anything. Not on this flight. I guess if we want anything you have to get it yourself from the uninspiring ""Club Kitchen"". Breakfast ok and flight arrived slightly early.

I could get a refund on the return portion my flight, which leaves me nowhere as there is no reasonably cheap option to re-book. Or they could fly me into Seattle on Tuesday and I must make my way home from there on my own dime, and I could submit for reimbursement from BA - no guarantees they will reimburse though.

We tried to check in on line and were unable to. When we arrived at check in we were initially told that even though we had booked through tickets that they could not issue boarding passes for the full journey as there was less than 2.5 hours turn around time and we would have to collect our baggage from re claim and check in again. we pointed out that this would certainly cause us to miss the flight and as we were flying to Costa Rica it was unlikely that there would be a suitable alternate flight that day and we would lose a day of our holiday waiting around in Madrid airport.

"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to London. My flight was cancelled on November 17th. The day I was supposed to fly in the evening, I received text when I was in middle of doing important last minute arrangements that I had to leave in middle. After talking to one of the agents for hour and a half, I was able to get alternative flight that was leaving from Charlotte instead of New York. In order to get this new flight I had to be at JFK Airport at 1:45 pm. To make this happen, I had to skip all last minute arrangements. The flight from Charlotte means more commuting and more discomfort because it was not direct flight to London. Our 7 hours flight turned into 12 hours. On top of longer and uncomfortable commuting, I was unable to sit with my children. The meal I requested was not available on the new flight. Absolute worst experience! While flying back from London to New York on November 27th, we got the flight as scheduled but the crew didn’t have our requested meal available! It was my first experience with British Airways and I’ll make sure it’s the last one. On my flight back to New York I requested water to one of the attendants and she didn’t turn back for 9 minutes!

"✅ Trip Verified | Flew British Airways from Bangkok to Aberdeen via Heathrow. No complaints. Flight a little delayed on the return leg but all-in-all was good.

"✅ Trip Verified | Flew British Airways from Rotterdam to London City. Our trip started with a delay due to a technical problem, but we were promptly rebooked on the next flight which took off a little over an hour later, so that was not a big problem. Nice aircraft with good legroom and a friendly crew, providing a drink and a snack on this 40min flight. Inbound flight had a delay of 45 mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point BA needs to improve. Also check in via BA-app didn't work both ways, so again there's room for improvement. Would still recommend especially on this route because of the short check-in times and short walkways at Rotterdam and London City. Price can be high though, especially when you have checked luggage, but we hadn't and I booked well in advance. Paid 200 euros rtn for two, which was fine.

"✅ Trip Verified | Flew British Airways from London to Cape Town. Where to start! Yesterday 6th January our flight had been rescheduled from 18.30 for 11am today, due to technical problems which they couldn't fix that night. After a fair amount of announcements it was decided we would be put up at the Hilton hotel next door. So we all had to go back to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the BA desk to collect our vouchers. We duly went along to the Hilton hotel and waited in line to eventually be told there were no more rooms available to the rest of us - by now it was 10pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained, especially those with small children. The desk staff told us they were trying to phone BA to ask what to do with the rest of us but were getting no answer from them. So at this stage my husband and I decided to come home and got a very expensive taxi back to London safe in the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 11am on the 7th January. We duly left home this morning at 8am to get here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 18.30 tonight. Oh dear BA, why couldn't you let us all know this by sending an email with a phone number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night? Just too efficient for you I guess. So we've been kindly issued with vouchers to cover breakfast which they didnt do, no problem BA we didn't mind forking out another £5 to cover it.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to London return – business to London and First back to Toronto all on Avios. Fast check in at Pearson with the usual friendly check in team. Fast track was quick and in the new 3rd party lounge within 15 mins. BA (presumably to save money) have shut their lounge and gone to a 3rd party provider – Premium Plaza. Its frankly awful, no class or professionalism, with limited wine and spirits options, and cheap and nasty food piled high. Elevator music drove us mad, and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft - (what on earth are you thinking BA?) Fast boarding, though with fewer crew, the boarding service in club is fragmented. Late with Champagne, wash bag after take off etc. With only four crew working club, there just isn’t time to offer a quality pre flight experience. The new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages. We were served drinks 80 minutes into the flight and as we were near the back of the cabin, had our meal 10 mins after being served drinks. All choices were available but the food is just not club standard. Poor entrees, cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago. BA really need to roll out the new meal service quickly – how long does the new pilot service to New York have to last for?? Got some sleep, had an okay fast breakfast (passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin) with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight. Returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new First check in, fast track and Concorde lounge. Excellent service on boarding, a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food –all choices available. Some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea. Dry sandwiches with mean fillings, but okay cakes and scones. Early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags (45 mins after landing). These were my first mixed fleet Biz and first class service experiences. The crew were young, and lacking experience / knowledge but make an enthusiastic, polite and smart. However, they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service. Long haul crew were cranky at times, but they would connect better and offer a more sleek / fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Manchester via London. Fairly dire as always. BA is cutting the new Club World product as I speak, before even having rolled it out. Addicted to cuts. Perfect partner for AA. So I get on board and am told I now need to purchase food and beverages on the domestic leg, so why did I not fly a low cost airline? There no difference whatsoever? The crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperienced. And what do you get for food on a transatlantic 10 hour flight to Vegas? A starter of lettuce and carrot and two unripe cherry tomatoes. No oil, just some grey vinegar, it was foul I assume, nobody ate it. The main was tomato pasta or curry. The curry was so appalling I ate none of it. The chicken was like paste, the sauce dried out, and the rice overcooked. I cannot bear fruit so the only normal looking thing, a mini blueberry muffin, was given to my ravenous neighbour. No cheese, crackers these days, nothing. Served with cold tea. I really loved, also, being rammed on a transfer bus from T3 to LHR T5 having waited 30 minutes to get on bus sweating like crazy. The driver just kept shouting to move down the bus, it won't leave until it is full! Then the busses onto the back of the plane even though the bridge is on. And to top it all of, BA now offers a free copy of the Sun instead of the Mail or Express. I have another flight in May which is non-refundable, I am desperately hoping they move my flight so I can cancel, they usually do this 2 or 3 times a booking so feeling good. This is not a full service airline. It is fully no frills. The only exception is, I think, is the long haul canteen meal you get. The airline is a national embarrassment. The flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given, but the ground staff are beyond it. Fly this budget airline at your own peril, think about spending a bit more.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to London. Service Ryanair wouldn't tolerate but with premium prices. Every two years or so I fly with BA, and every two years I am reminded just why I don't normally fly with them. Whilst not as bad as my previous experience (which chopped about 12 hours off a 2 day break to Milan and left me £££ out of pocket as all public transport had stopped by the time we arrived, an no, they wouldn't refund me) we were still delayed. All the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things. BA? Didn't show the delay until we should have been boarding. Get to the gate with my shopping (what else are you to do during a delay?) and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they'll put one of my bags in the hold. Even Ryanair allows a bag of duty free on. It would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no~ that wasn't allowed. Once we were on board the reason became clear, just like easyJet, Ryanair and many of the other budget airlines, BA doesn't include a checked bag, meaning that all the hand luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag. So not only was the flight delayed, but I now had to wait for a suitcase. Once we arrived at Gatwick everything went smoothly, I managed to catch the last train to my destination (unlike the previous time I'd flown with them). Additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers. Do not fly BA, save your money and go with a budget airline.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Johannesburg. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the flight was from LHR-JNB, I booked this flight as it was a direct flight, and although it was around £130 more than Emirates and Qatar airways, it saved around 10 hours off of the journey. The A380 seats were reasonably comfortable and I had plenty of leg room, the cabin crew were professional and prompt when requested. Inflight entertainment was ok with a good selection of movies (they do need updating though as some were released early 2017), lack of onboard WiFi is a big letdown too.

Our seats in business class were also broken and food was late as one of the ovens was broken. Cabin crew said the aircraft shouldn't have been in service. I agree. Flight home was cancelled by text at 5.30pm day before return. No assistance provided by BA. Told it wasn't there problem and sort my own accommodation out. Took nearly 2 hours hanging on the phone before anyone would reluctantly agree to rebook me onto another flight. Was told club seats weren't available on the only flight with seats departing within 7 days so reluctantly accepted economy seats. Was told I couldn't have a refund of the difference between club and economy. Looked at BA site later that day and club seats were available on the flight they had re-booked me onto. Called back but they refused to put me in the cabin I had paid for saying I had volunteered to downgrade and I would have to pay to upgrade (£600 each) plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were trying to charge me twice for.

"✅ Trip Verified | I flew Premium Economy from London to Cape Town on British Airways. Having flown Premium Economy before, I had certain expectations of what I would be getting, but I was sorely disappointed - this was by far the most expensive Premium Economy I have ever flown and, unfortunately, also by far the worst. The plane was old and tired and clearly in need of some refurbishment. From Premium Economy, I expected wider seats and more legroom - the seats were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system was located in the side of the seat, where I was constantly pushing against it. I finally gave up and hung the remote control over the side of the seat. The personal entertainment system with noise-reducing headphones - the screen was tiny, the blind next to me could not be pulled down. The headphones were plugged into the side of the seat, where I kept knocking them, but the quality was inferior, to the point that I spent the flight having to hold the headphones plugged in, so that I could actually hear anything. Expected to board ahead of economy passengers with priority boarding - no priority boarding at all. I find it shocking that BA charges exorbitant prices to fly planes that quite clearly are on their last legs. I needed to change my return flight. after having tried several times, with no success, I phoned BA and was on hold for about 15 minutes, after which I gave up and just cancelled the flight, which worked first time.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Montreal. Very bad service with delayed luggage. For some reason the person at london heathrow send my suitcase under someone else's name and to a different destination. I was flying from London to Montreal and my suitcase was sent to Dublin. First guy I talked on the phone, after a week of no news at all, he told me that the suitcase was found but was left there at the airport and no further action was taken. Were they waiting for me to ask them to send it or something? In theory, he sent an email asking the airport to send my suitcase to Montreal. But after another week of no further news and website still saying suitcase is missing, I decided to call them again to find out that my suitcase, was still in Dublin. A second email, was sent to get my suitcase send it to me. A couple of days after and of course, with no news at all from them, I decided to call them back again. This time my suitcase wasn't in Dublin, it was sent to London Heathrow and they lost it again at that airport. This guy, asked me to call them back, Monday morning London time, so I did. I called back again on Monday morning, and after being about 10 minutes waiting for the guy to connect to his London team, he asked me to go to the website to add description of the items in my suitcase, when I had done that same day I placed the delayed luggage report. Don't they have all this info in file?. After telling him that I did that, first day, he then asked me to call them back in 48h again. I'm tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcase. No compensation was mentioned to me, even that I had to buy clothes and some other items that I already had in my suitcase. Lucky enough, this happened in my final destination and at the end of my trip, otherwise they would make my vacation quiet miserable. I understand, there is a huge number of suitcases traveling around everyday but that's no reason to let you wondering and waiting forever to get what's yours. I think this whole experience would have been much more satisfying if they showed some empathy and instead of making me wait and call them all the time, I would have get a call or email from them every once in a while following up with me.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Houston. Executive gold club refused to help me or keep us informed about the case that did not get put on to the flight they subsequently missed another two days of flights at 6 possible flights per day. The staff were steadfastly of the opinion that this is not problem because we have received a card with 801 USD to buy essential items and that is sufficient in their eyes, furthermore they were more interested in leaving to go home and had ticked all the boxes at their end. Needless to say that because we are away for Christmas & New Year we cannot wear the basics for dinner another fact that really made no impact nor was it of any consequence to gold club team. I repeatedly explained that we could not attend dinner without the proper attire which is currently residing in the case that BA and baggage handlers have deemed less than priority. Because we have been given 801 USD No phone calls can be made to update us and the website advises that they are currently looking for the luggage which would be the same case that was dismissed from being loaded onto today's flight. Furthermore the suitcase could go on a minimum of 6 flights per day including the actual day it was not sent as there was a later flight which would have reunited the bag with the owner & negated the requirement of giving us 801 USD in the first place The callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal has ruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested BA return us home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves.

"✅ Trip Verified | Flew British Airways from Dubai to London Heathrow. Overnight flight that departed on time and arrived 25 minutes early to a very easy to navigate through T5. Unfortunately this was the only positive aspect of my flight. Flight was on board a very old 744 with very poor inflight entertainment. B747 are beautiful old planes but the interiors should be updated. The food was OK. The biggest disappointment was the cabin crew who all seemed miserable and not interested. No smiles or even a ""welcome on board"" whilst walking down the aisle. On arrival they were standing together talking and laughing and not even acknowledging any of the passengers. The service provided by BA has significantly declined over the past few years. Even the newer planes (B777 and B787) haven't got cabins that compete with todays market. Also, just like other budget airlines, you now have to pay to choose your seat.

"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Tokyo Narita to London Heathrow with British Airways. Flight delayed by four hours - which is understandable due to the weather in the UK at the time. The inflight entertainment was awful. It was good for only a short haul journey. Very limited selection and very dated equipment/screens. Plus they kept stalling. The staff were ok, although a few seemed allergic to smiling and seemed glum. We were fed at the beginning of the journey and then not until an hour towards the end. The food was average and I was very hungry throughout the service. As far as I am aware, on a long haul flight especially the services are to help you feel as comfortable as possible - I don’t call being starved very comfortable!

However, the crew on the ground handled the situation quite well and provided all passengers with food-vouchers and even the captain came out of the plane to explain the situation. However, there was no information on connecting flights in LHR.

Three requests and then it materialised and that too for a young child. At check-in their automated system failed so it was done manually - thank goodness for carbon units still employed by BA.

✅ Trip Verified |  London to Toulouse. British Airways is no longer a full service airline. To compete with EasyJet and Ryan Air it has removed food and drink from economy class and replaced with M&S food. This is over-priced and not that great. Secondly the food was never complementary- it was included in your ticket price. This was the case in this flight to Toulouse. Next time go to Pret and get a meal from there and carry it on board. I asked for a glass of water. This came in the last 30 minutes of the flight once the trolley had gone down the aisle. At least offer people water - it is a human right. The seats too are tight and a rear toilet in economy has been removed to maximise profits. In this flight there was no spare tissue or toilet roll.  I was told by the cabin crew when I asked about the new service level that more may be in store for BA's comers - charging for food in economy class for long haul flights. I hope that this is not true. The only saving grace is a comprehensive network and flight times are good. Customer care and service has gone. Avoid BA if you can.

While the terminal, staff, aircraft, and seats are of the same high standards as before - the free in-flight meals and beverages have disappeared and must now be purchased. It seems that BA is slowly morphing into a low-cost carrier at least as far as European destinations are concerned. Presumably, this is due to the competition from Easyjet and Ryanair as well as it's CEO hailing from Vueling.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Edinburgh via London was the worst travel experience I have had. I was travelling with 2 seniors (+85 & +70) we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving. We actually had to beg for help. The distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors. In our way from London to Edinburgh it was a nightmare. The flight was delayed and we got to London about an hour late, on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care. The 2 seniors had to walk all that way. It was not only the walking, it was the rush they had, as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 1:30 hours. On our way back from Inverness to Canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance. Once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate. Again we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. They said that they called the buggy and that was all. We said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates/ terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all. We were lucky I asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 (in London) and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point. This gentleman who is not British Airways employee provided a great service. Summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance I asked and he decided to help us out. Seats were another problem. We did the online check in (24 before) and we had the seats already chosen 12D for one senior (isle) and 18D (isle) for the other senior. When we got to the counter in Inverness Airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats. Then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats. So once again, more walking for them, problems to get in/out the seats, and of course problem to get to the washroom. - luggage another problem! British Airways in Inverness said that the luggage goes directly to Victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in Vancouver. Surprise surprise! We went through customs and when we got to Westjet counter for the connection to Victoria they asked for the luggage.  They said we had to pick it up before going through customs. There was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the Westjet staff to contact somebody from British Airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. So nightmare again!! And another rush to us to get to the next fligh. According to Westhet agents they said that British airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection. What can you expect from British Airways? If It doesn’t even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance.

"✅ Trip Verified | London to Berlin Tegel return. It's becoming ever more difficult to notice any difference between British Airways and the budget airlines. The only saving grace is that I've never experienced any issues flying out of or into T5. Noticeable cost cutting measures include the removal of complimentary onboard food and drink but also, BA have removed a toilet in economy within their A319 fleet to make space for seats in row 24 and 25 meaning there is only one economy toilet, disgraceful.

"✅ Trip Verified | Flew London Heathrow to Dubai. Arrived at the new ""Wing"" at T5. A quick process and into the Concorde lounge. I noticed (as before) the check in staff do not mention the Concorde lounge per se. ""Just straight through there sir and into the 1st class lounge."" This option was rammed. Am pleased to confirm that the Concorde lounge has had a long overdue make-over. It looks a bit better. Had a snack and a few glasses of fizz - then made my way to terminal B. Friendly FA showed me and wife to our seats. Looked freshly cleaned. Pushed back on time. 1st Class was full. Airborne I had dinner: Mezze to start which was nice. Some chicken thingy for mains - which was horrible. Cheese and biscuits to conclude. Wines were ok. The seat (the new ""First"") - is not wearing well. Looking somewhat tired. Managed to get some sleep on the ""bed"" with the usual duvet and blankets. I am a tall guy and need the space. the Club World option is horrendous. Very pleased to confirm that Mr Alex Cruz (BAs CEO) has re-introduced flowers in the 1st WC. Readers will recall he cancelled these last year to save costs. If Mr Cruz wants to save costs he should get rid of the gas guzzlers 747-400s. So a full 1st cabin will generate about £40,000 of revenue. The flowers (for 2 WCs) probably cost £8.00 - so, pleased to see the airline is still flying and not gone bankrupt over the re-introduction of eight quids worth of flowers per flight. The 1st product is very mediocre compared with say Emirates. Some have said its ""sort of an upmarket Business class"". I'd agree with that.

"✅ Trip Verified | Berlin to London City. I have never experienced such an unreliable, unprofessional airline, that is so hard to contact. My flight kept being delayed for hours. After more than 4 hours delay, there was no point for me to fly to London anymore, as I had missed an important meeting. I was told that I will get my flight price refunded and also get a compensation. After a few days I call their customer support to ask about the refund. They told me that I will get the refund within 7 days. After 4 weeks, I notice that they still haven't refunded me. It's very difficult to contact them. The phone hotline is only available until 5pm (Monday-Friday). They hide the contact form somewhere deep in their website. Once I managed to send them a message, I only get a reply a few days later telling me, that they can't reply to this case via email and that I should call. All I want at this point is to get my deserved flight price refund. I take an hour off my work to be able to call in their short opening times. After being on hold for a while, it turns out, they made a mistake and will refund me the ticket within the next 48 hours.

"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Newcastle to San Francisco via London Heathrow with British Airways. One issue after another! The flight from Newcastle boarded early but due to weather conditions in London, we departed late. We should have had a two hour lay-over for our connecting flight but arrived only thirty minutes prior to departure to San Francisco and were told at disembarkation that we had been re-routed via Washington! Our booked flight to San Francisco also departed late and we sat in the lounge watching it push back. We finally got on the Washington bound aircraft but were again delayed in order to allow late arriving passengers from Amsterdam to catch the flight. The delay meant that the late departure was then caught up in a computer problem at Heathrow thus delaying the flight further. We eventually arrived in Washington twenty minutes before the next connecting flight - there was an announcement over the tannoy system for us to hurry up but no physical help available. Obviously we missed the flight and spent the next hour (around about 23.00) trying to find help at the check-in desk in a practically empty airport. United (acting on behalf of BA) checked us onto a flight the following morning and the BA staff eventually found us a hotel room thirty minutes drive away. Ironically, the BA personnel had been busy ensuring the the passengers from Amsterdam that had caused the late departure made their connecting flight and were therefore not available to help us! We were also downgraded to economy on the flight between Washington and San Francisco as business class was full. We eventually got to San Francisco about 22 hours after our scheduled arrival. BA offered no compensation for either the time lost or the down-grade in class. They did pay for the taxi from the hotel and the cost of the pre-booked (but unused) hotel in San Francisco.

"✅ Trip Verified | Very disappointing. I was scheduled on a British Airways flight to connect to a long haul flight at Heathrow and having flown BA in the past it was very sad to see how BA service went down this year.

"✅ Trip Verified | This was really a no frills business class. This flight was part of trip with Qatar Airways. Unfortunately, the London to Doha was operated by British Airways. The seat is cramped and really outdated compared to the other major airlines. The IFE was really poor with old screen system and poor range of options. The meal was not good related to the price you have to pay. The FAs were really dull, nothing wrong but no effort to communicate with passengers like FAs from other airlines.

"✅ Trip Verified | British Airways is seriously lacking in all areas. Singapore to Sydney return in economy. Fly the route often, usually with Qantas which are great. The flight out to Sydney is only 7.5 hours and over night - most people are looking to maximise their sleep. Especially those who have come from London. Cabin crew were surly, unhelpful and seemed rushed and disorganised. After departure they took almost three hours to get the dinner service over and done with and turn off the lights so people could get some rest. During the flight cabin crew chatted loudly and seemed unaware that people may actually want to rest and get some sleep. The food is very average also. Two hours before landing, they serve a pre landing breakfast snack of a sandwich wrapped in plastic. No tea or coffee. The competition is too strong for this route.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Basel. Boarding: There are now so many 'priority boarding' passengers that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like second-class citizens. (The new numbering system is likely to cement this impression further.) Since I was traveling on a 'low-price' ticket, I found myself seated right at the back of the airplane. Yes, BA appears intent on replicating England's class system!  On board there was a delay of 40 minutes due to a French ATC strike. Obviously, this was not BA's fault, but no drinks, not even water was offered during the wait on the tarmac. After take off, the drinks trolley moved painfully slowly down the cabin. Why BA offer heated sandwiches, further slowing down their BOB service even further, when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place, is beyond me. The no-cash policy further contributes to the snail-pace progress of the trolley. The trolley (and a cup of tea) was within grasping distance as the captain announced we would be landing in ten minutes. End of service. Someone at the back quipped, 'So you opted for the premium seats, too!' Yes, BA is a joke, its attitude towards passengers (its customers) shameless and embarrassing. It wasn't until I had left the airport that I was able to get that cup of tea. Needless to say, Eurowings and EasyJet do things much better.",3,2017-11-24, United Kingdom ,True,london heathrow basel boarding many priority boarding passenger fall category left feel like second class citizen new numbering system likely cement impression since traveling low price ticket found seated right back airplane yes ba appears intent replicating england class system board delay minute due french atc strike obviously ba fault drink even water offered wait tarmac take drink trolley moved painfully slowly cabin ba offer heated sandwich slowing bob service even two ec cabin crew serving first place beyond cash policy contributes snail pace progress trolley trolley cup tea within grasping distance captain announced would landing ten minute end service someone back quipped opted premium seat yes ba joke attitude towards passenger customer shameless embarrassing left airport able get cup tea needle say eurowings easyjet thing much better
"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to London Heathrow. A bit of a mixed bag. Boarding at Miami was conducted efficiently and the flight departed on time, albeit that some passengers were still getting into their seats as the aircraft was pushed back! So much for safety. Seat would not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable flight and subsequent aching back on arrival at Heathrow. Also my wife’s IFE failed mid flight. Impossible to hear information from the flight deck. These ageing 747’s really are in desperate need of replacement. The congealed chicken curry was disgusting and unpalatable, the alternative pasta dish was deemed acceptable. The minimal breakfast offering leaves a lot to be desired.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Prague to Washington via London. British Airways has turned out to be the worst airline I have flown. Unfortunately I am forced to fly them often from PRG, if I want to connect on their One World partner AA, which I have Exec Plat status with. BA charges for everything, including water. PRG-LHR is on a small business class seat (same as in economy), dried up breakfast that was tasteless, flight attendants that could not care less and when I asked for coffee told me they were landing soon (40 mins before landing) and that I should have thought of it earlier. London to Washington  was on a broken down 747, seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor. Had to be moved twice before they found functioning seat.

The extra added costs for flying over LHR and paying extra  tax is ridiculous. BA, what is it about your flights PRG-LHR, with your onboard luggage allowance only?

"✅ Trip Verified |  Cape Town to London. I can report a positive experience on our flight. From the moment we boarded, cabin crew were polite and efficient, and provided a high-class service throughout. Seats 4E/F suffer a bit from poor storage space and a lack of privacy, but they are the best for a couple. Glasses were kept topped-up even before take-off. The menu provided four choices of both starter and mains, and all the dishes were both well-presented and well-cooked. Talking to cabin crew, it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care, and this really showed on the flight. The IFE screen was the usual low resolution with a limited selection of films. Still no WiFi, of course. Take-off and landing was on schedule, and announcements from the cockpit had that typical air of friendly professionalism.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to London Heathrow. Despite all the negative reviews I decided to fly with BA on my recent trip to Europe, on this route BA has a daylight flight (I can't stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you can't sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted), more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service. The fare was also pretty good. In the end, I have to admit my mates were right, this was a let down all along. My issues were the following. I purchased a ticket in premium economy. The advertised seats on the BA Thailand website were reflecting the newer version, when in fact not one of the 777-200 which operates the LHR-BKK-LHR route have been refitted. The seat date from the early 2000's - almost two decades ago, and I had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat. Come on ! Yes I got my amenities kit, a better pillow British papers and pre-departures drinks, a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus. But the seat is old, not that comfy, the IFE belongs to the late 90's and is a disgrace to the industry. Great sound, good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality. I spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as I could not see squat. The seat itself is way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirty. It was however A bit better out of LHR but still not that great. The meal service was not good out of BKK. Bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack - just a napkin. Main dish was ok, but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke. No cheese nor crackers. Not enough at all, you are left starving, and in economy it is even worst. I have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit. Cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the J/C had a brand new a la carte service as well.  Cabin crew operating both legs were great - professional, approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks. Out of LHR the main meal was this time pretty good, including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert. The only false note was the meal pre-selection. You get served first as they do with special meals - but do not offer you any drinks. You have to wait for a very long time. By then my meal was cold and i sent it back. They did replace it right away, but this was clearly a waste of time. Pre-selecting your meal, means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak. Pax with Special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway. Other than that it was this time a decent meal. Having said that, there was no middle service, which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack. Not acceptable on such a long haul. Funny enough the BKK-LHR feature three meals so why not on the LHR-BKK leg ?. BA could be so much better. They have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right - and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years ago.

"✅ Trip Verified | After 3 hour delay at airport, flight destined for Verona with arrival time of 21.35, was rerouted to Venice, meaning bus transfer and arrival at 2.30am. We passsengers were informed minutes before boarding plane of this change. I had planned to stay the night with a friend who was going to pick me up at the airport. At such an unsociable hour of the morning, I could no longer disturb her. I explained all this to BA, who advised me that a rep would help me find a hotel and I would be reimbursed. On arrival, I was brusquely told by a BA rep to go online and find my own accommodation. After a more than 5 hour delay, my phone had no battery life. I was left to borrow a fellow passenger's phone and search for the cheapest motel near the airport - miles away from where I should have been. It transpires BA knew there had been technical problems in the morning of the flight - yet sent passengers an email urging us to get to the airport even earlier. I wasted 5 hours at Gatwick (when I could have carried on working). Also had I known, would have tried to get on an earlier flight or postpone our journey. To top it all, when all 150 passengers finally arrived at the deserted airport of Verona at 2.30 am - no taxis. BA had not thought of contacting local taxis informing them of a queue of tired clients. Further wait. Not only had I missed my dinner reunion, to my astonishment British Airways has refused to reimburse my hotel bill, stating that they had after all got me to my destination. I hadn't even counted the extra taxi bills I incurred (£45) - but I did expect BA to reimburse the 50€ hotel as a goodwill gesture.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Tel Aviv to London. We arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take. The stories were true, although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport, they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc. There were limited priority options available for First Class passengers, although I suspect that is more down to the airport than British Airways. The lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first, and isn’t really acceptable. If it was just business then it would be ‘fine I guess’ but there is not very much seating, the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited. Even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another, very complicated, machine with all instructions only in Hebrew. At the gate there was the usual ‘priority boarding’ queue as well as the regular queue. But the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all Oneworld emerald, sapphire and ruby members - which is a lot of people! Whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members, there really should be another queue for first and Oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long. The service on board didn’t start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew I got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc, and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front I had to go to the galley and ask. They were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldn’t happen in first. The seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space. Annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing, which limits how much you can watch. It was the Thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch. The food and drinks on board were all excellent, including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well. Aside from the hiccup at the beginning, the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special. It would have been nice to have been referred to by name, which I have had before on BA and with other airlines, even in business class. On arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there, which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick. Overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew, let down only by the ground service in Israel.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Tel Aviv. Arrived at Heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy, but check and security felt like it was 10pm, very easy and quick process (which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn’t follow the signs properly). We used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor, although they did later improve. The food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches, soup and some dry cake. This wasn’t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty. Drinks overall were good as always with British Airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling. In terms of seating, there was enough for all the passengers in there, and it was quite busy, and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place, although better variety in seating, including some more comfortable chairs, would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising. This biggest failing was the staff in the lounge, which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges. Smiles are free and go a long way, and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality, eerily walking around slightly like a zombie, seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd! The other area which I find completely below standard are the toilets. Whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc, the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room. The regular Heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality. Whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice, there aren’t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier. On board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin. This meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access. These seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and access. Unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife, which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution, selection and even the fact that some screens won’t even stay in place and fold themselves away! British Airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft, end of story! Even the Thales system is showing its age now, but this Rockwell Collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art! The cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience. Some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc, and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly. Others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience. Food and drinks on board were actually quite good, although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Madrid via London. My first time flying BA and I had very low expectations. Fortunately, my experience was pleasant as the seats were generally comfortable and overall service was good. The service (KUL-LHR) was brusque. Meal was served not long after take off and my child was already sleeping as it was past midnight. I had asked if we could have it later but the reply was a curt NO and that they couldn't give it to us later nor would they have any snacks to offer. So if we got hungry we would just have to wait more than 8 hours later for the next meal. Luckily on the return route we had a very courteous cabin crew who spoke politely. Both aircrafts appeared new and the seats were wide enough for us. Some people complained about the entertainment unit under the seats. What I didn't like though is that the arm rest couldn't be kept up totally between the 2 seats so that my child could lie across his seat and mine. The armrest kind of went up to a max of 80 degree angle. The seat pockets were very small so there's very little that can kept inside. The toilets were generally clean but the toilet seat lids didn't work properly. They always fall back down and there was never seat liners.

❎ Not Verified |  Madrid to London Heathrow on a busy Monday evening in November was an entirely mixed affair. Boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed. Boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage. This resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the hold. Some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff. Every single seat was occupied. This was quite hard on the staff. A trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain UK based TV personalities. This was in English only. The inflight service was very poor. I ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at me. Disembarkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggage. I regard this as a health and safety matter.

❎ Not Verified |  Flew British Airways from Bologna to London Heathrow. We arrived at Bologna Airport to be told at the bag check in that the plane had been overbooked and that we would have to wait until boarding closed before we would know if there was a seat for us. We were both amazed and surprised since we had booked this return flight several weeks earlier and had arrived at the airport in good time. The member of staff dealing with us was particularly brusque and unhelpful and the only information that we were given was a typed sheet setting out the fact that if we did not travel we would be able to claim compensation. For us this was not acceptable since we had to be in the Lake District the following day. We were eventually allowed onto the plane but would not have made it if it had not been for a fellow passenger who seemed to know how to get around the queues in this situation.

"❎ Not Verified |  My husband and I booked our honeymoon to Italy through American Airlines which unknowingly routed us to their partner airlines, British Airways. We ran immediately into trouble when we received an email notice that our flights have been changed and we now had a 40 minute layover at London Heathrow and we would not arrive in Rome in the AM as planned. We decided to give it a shot regardless. We arrived at BWI and discovered we were not on an AA flight and had packed more bags than BA would allow. (We had three checked bags instead of 2 and British Airways only allows one checked bag or you pay close to $100 for additional). Luckily the gentlemen at the counter checked the bag at no charge. I can't say the same for the rest of our trip. We found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats together for a 6.5 hr flight and we had 2 middle seats. The neighbors on our flight refused to swap seats, originally then after some pity complaining a lovely woman swapped. We arrived into London around 9am. late of course, and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection, we missed our flight and were unable to make it through security. The BA representative told us the next flight was full and we would have to wait until 5pm. We again explained that we were on our honeymoon and had afternoon ticket reservations in Rome. The BA representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight - so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to get into Rome for dinner. Upon our return flights, we attempted three times to reserve seats online via British Airways app and web (learning from before) and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my PayPal account. We eventually had to make an international call and pay $174 to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the 8 hr flight home, though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to London. Once we arrived at Rome to check - we got hit with the $100 additional baggage fee (we we tried to explain, the representative refused to comp the bag). Upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra bag that was not paid for. Luckily, we had the receipt from paying 2 hrs earlier.

"✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Brussels. I had to travel for a surgery that had to be done in Belgium. Going there the staff at check-in in were amazing, as I had missed my plane she did everything possible for me to be on the next flight at a good price. However coming back to London the staff were quite rude and not acknowledging. I got on the plane and asked if I could have help to place my hand luggage into the locker as I could not carry anything nor lift my hand due to my operation. The first staff member at the entrance told me that I had to ask a member of staff closer to my seat, if no one could help then he will try to come. So that’s what I did, but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasn’t allowed to carry a bag unless I help her and even after explaining the situation, she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcase. Luckily another passenger heard me and carried my bag to the top and helped my get it down at the end.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon. I was flying my return leg back to Korea after a Christmas vacation. I had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and unfortunately had no better experience on the return. To start with, i was unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical fault. Having not had my selection available on the outbound leg (in business class!) i wanted to ensure i had something for my return. I couldn't pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had AGAIN run out of 50% of the available selections. Quite disgraceful. I was also unable to check in on line, so i was ""directed"" by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not work. Eventually i made it passed the staff and was allowed to queue for the business class check in. The rest of the airport process after that was smooth. This time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin in the window seat. This meant that I did not have to step over somebody else feet and legs if I wanted to get out of my chair in flight. Of course I had to pay extra $'s for the seat selection in business class - a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a premium cabin. The flight was uneventful. On this occasion I had a very warm crew for which I appreciated. Overall I still feel that BA is just too cheap on it's product and this is not an acceptable practice especially in a premium class. Frankly, even though they were the cheaper ticket price by the time I had paid extra for the seat and not had my meal choices available i would have been better off flying another carrier.",9,2017-11-17, South Korea ,False,review london heathrow seoul incheon flying return leg back korea christmas vacation pleasant experience initial leg unfortunately better experience return start unable pre order meal line due technical fault selection available outbound leg business class wanted ensure something return pre book course offered meal cabin crew run available selection quite disgraceful also unable check line directed staff use kiosk airport also work eventually made passed staff allowed queue business class check rest airport process smooth time sat rear business class cabin window seat meant step somebody else foot leg wanted get chair flight course pay extra seat selection business class point made unhappy premium cabin flight uneventful occasion warm crew appreciated overall still feel ba cheap product acceptable practice especially premium class frankly even though cheaper ticket price time paid extra seat meal choice available would better flying another carrier
"✅ Verified Review |  Seoul Incheon to London Heathrow. This was my first flight on BA for many years. As a Brit, I was actually looking forward to flying them in order to return home for Christmas on board the relatively new B787. I was disappointed. The fare I paid on this occasion was relatively good value for a J class cabin - in my view. However, it was extremely disappointing to see that you have to pay to select your seat in J class. I do not know of and have not ever flown another airline which charges you for this and I certainly do not appreciate it. I was seated in row 1 by the window. My first experience in this cabin was a shock when I realised I was looking straight into the face of the passenger sitting next to me. And further that i had to step over the legs of the passenger in row 2 to get into and out from my seat. The tray table did not sit straight when pulled out for service. Even in row 1, by the time the cabin crew came to take my meal order they were already telling me that two of the available options had already run out. This left me taking a Korean option on a flight on BA where the majority of the passengers seemed to be non-Korean. Clearly something wrong with the meal ratios. They offer a serve yourself snack bar in flight. I went to the galley at one point and there was very little available to take food wise - it was mostly just drinks. It also seemed to be a fixed meal time - something else i do not appreciate in business class these days when dine on demand is a far better option for passengers. The IFE selection was nothing more than average. I found the overall selection somewhat limited compared to other carriers. The service and product simply left me feeling that BA is way behind other carriers and I concluded that i would not make a point of flying with them again on a long haul route in a premium cabin.",5,2017-11-16, South Korea ,False,review seoul incheon london heathrow first flight ba many year brit actually looking forward flying order return home christmas board relatively new b disappointed fare paid occasion relatively good value j class cabin view however extremely disappointing see pay select seat j class know ever flown another airline charge certainly appreciate seated row window first experience cabin shock realised looking straight face passenger sitting next step leg passenger row get seat tray table sit straight pulled service even row time cabin crew came take meal order already telling two available option already run left taking korean option flight ba majority passenger seemed non korean clearly something wrong meal ratio offer serve snack bar flight went galley one point little available take food wise mostly drink also seemed fixed meal time something else appreciate business class day dine demand far better option passenger ife selection nothing average found overall selection somewhat limited compared carrier service product simply left feeling ba way behind carrier concluded would make point flying long haul route premium cabin

Next to me was somebody who was too large to comfortably be able to occupy a middle seat. The crew could have helped the poor person out by offering an aisle but they made no attempt. So three people suffered cramped conditions for 11 hours. The food is awful, poor quality and with poor selection of wines - cheap Spanish wine with no choice, the cabin was over heated.

"✅ Verified Review |  British Airways short haul Business Class is nothing more than an economy class seat and maximum 31 inch pitch, with lounge access and a meal thrown in. So is it worth paying three times the cost of an economy ticket? BA recently introduced Business Class on domestic routes and as I got a decent price for booking well in advance, decided to try it out. Checking in was efficient, and the Galleries Club Lounge adequate (no comparison whatsoever with Asian or Middle Eastern Airline lounges). Priority boarding although announced, did not make any difference as economy and business class passengers were in the same queue and confused. Having maneuvered into the cramped seat, I was offered a hot towel as soon as I sat down. I couldn't decide whether to be amused or embarrassed by the new celebrity cast safety video. It was more spot the stars, than listen to the safety instructions. But I guess it was something different BA was trying out. The service on board was surprisingly efficient and swift. Soon after take off, a tasty snack and bar service with premium brands was offered on this one hour flight. The service was good, considering a one hour flight. Despite a Boeing 767, 2x2x2 layout, the cabin felt claustrophobic. To me, this was no different than economy seating, with virtually no leg room. How can this be branded as Business Class?

"✅ Verified Review |  I requested Asian vegetarian food both ways including my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick on the 6th November, but I was very disappointed that my requirement was not fulfilled.  I was told that on my connection flight I have to pick up my luggage and then check it again at Phoenix airport for connection flight which I never heard before as normally all the airlines do the checking luggage transfer themselves and passengers just have to do security checks and board the flight. When I reached Phoenix first security took long time to clear then luggage took time to come then I had to go on the different level to check in, then down to go through security again to board my flight. On my return flight from Oakland to Gatwick when I went to the check in luggage I was told by the staff at the desk that TSA will break my lock to check through my luggage, so please keep it unlocked.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Santiago. Cabin crew generally helpful and friendly. Cabin a bit grubby; crumbs, nuts and grime in evidence. On the flight home as I took my seat I saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight - evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough. The alcoholic drinks were all pleasant. The food was of variable quality (as was the coffee) none bad, some a bit mediocre, some good. Many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and I found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another, sleeping, passenger's legs trying not to wake them up. The other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you can't watch it, as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you. On both flights I found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that I would have to look at it at an angle. I solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit, but then I had to take it out every time I got out of my seat. Another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal; apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer. And that adds to the litter problem. After you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin, what do you do with it? Er, drop it on the floor? I did manage to sleep quite well, though the pillow you are provided with is very thin. On the flight back they gave me another one when I asked. Another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket, sweater or whatever, the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer. And I don't want to seem a bit picky, but although the in-flight entertainment has a good choice of films, the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating; they are all divided into categories such as ""comedy"", ""thrillers"" etc but no A-Z. All in all, it wasn't an unpleasant experience but I would advise BA, if they were interested in my advice, that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and re-think the seat configuration.",2,2017-11-11, United Kingdom ,False,review london santiago cabin crew generally helpful friendly cabin bit grubby crumb nut grime evidence flight home took seat saw bit wrapper ear plug give seemed left previous flight evidence whoever wields vacuum cleaner passenger board need bit thorough alcoholic drink pleasant food variable quality coffee none bad bit mediocre good many commented somewhat odd seat arrangement found bit palaver carefully step another sleeping passenger leg trying wake problem configuration video screen stowed take landing mean watch economy screen back seat front flight found screen seemed broken would lock position would look angle solved problem stuffing rolled magazine hinge bit take every time got seat another problem configuration storage space minimal apart overhead locker small drawer add litter problem taken polythene wrapper headphone blanket paper ring around napkin er drop floor manage sleep quite well though pillow provided thin flight back gave another one asked another small problem individual air conditioning vent seat take jacket sweater whatever lack storage space mean go overhead locker already filled little drawer want seem bit picky although flight entertainment good choice film menu system seeing bit irritating divided category comedy thriller etc z unpleasant experience would advise ba interested advice need clean plane often thoroughly think seat configuration

Actually, British Airways simply separated several seats in the front from the rest of the aircraft cabin with a curtain, and called this a business class! Moreover, our pre-flight accommodations were not any better than those of the economy class passengers because British Airways does not even have a lodge for business class passengers in Victoria Falls.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Mumbai. The electrics at my seat were not working. This may have been related but the remote control that was completely broken with loose  wires etc. - The call button light kept coming on and off on its own. It was impossible for me to control this and at the time that I did actually want to contact the flight attendant, I had to use my husband's remote control to do so. - Because the connection was loose on my remote, it meant that things were changing on my TV screen without me being able to control it e.g. I would press play on the screen, then the program would pause or start rewinding without me doing anything. Because my remote controller was broken, it would not return properly into the socket and kept 'pinging' back out. This was  annoying when you are trying to relax in your seat. The TV screen was  faulty. The usual 'push and release' button did not work, I had to push the button and then just try to 'pull' the screen, it was very tough. Even the cabin crew could not release it properly. My footrest was very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own - my husband had to help every time I wanted to move this. My husbands footrest was  broken - The charging socket at my seat did not work, so I could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flight. My husbands charging socket also did not work. the flight attendant told me that this was an issue on some of the other seats in our row. This is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seat/row kept opening throughout the flight. The attendant would shut it and then it would  open, this happened during take off and landing, as well as throughout the flight.  For this level of airline and Club World seat, it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipment.  This return flight was the first time that I have flown business class. We have spent tens of thousands of pounds on our American Express card to earn the points required and to generate the companion voucher, for us to be able to fly business class for our honeymoon. Whilst the outbound flight was great, I was very disappointed with the return flight and shocked by the poor quality of the seat. The hostess tried to reset my screen which made no difference and in fact, the situation got worse. Once I had tried to turn on the screen and once it the hostess had attempted a re-set; after that, the screen just kept flicking on and off for the remaining 3.5 hrs of the flight.

"✅ Verified Review |  I travelled to Johannesburg from London Heathrow on Sunday 22nd October on flight BA55 and my husband was meant to travel with my two daughters on the same flight on 23rd October. They were refused boarding on the grounds that children cannot travel with a single parent to South Africa. There was no such requirement on booking the tickets via BA's website and there was no notification of this by the airline at any stage. The requirement is not even on the front page of the embassy's website but well hidden under drop down menus. Usually when there are requirements like for ESTA for entry into US, BA sends a prompt. However, there was nothing in this case. BA had on its system that I (the other parent) had travelled BA already reach Johannesburg a day before. The BA counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband, who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternative. Instead they directed to use the website to cancel tickets. After being given the wrong email address first, when finally managed to get in touch with customer relations, they refused to refund the ticket cost, only refunded taxes 25% of total. The overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and off-putting. They said they would use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of GBP 2k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs of booking.

"✅ Verified Review |  Heathrow to Lyon. The worst customer service I have ever experienced! I arrived at the airport a good 2 hours before the flight only to be told that the flight is overbooked and that I could not check in. After a long wait to ascertain if anyone will not be turning up, I was told I can go on a different flight - the problem being that the only available flight was the one going out the following morning. So I missed a whole day's business meeting and was forced to do the round trip home and back to the airport in a matter of one day. When I queried the fact that I was unable to board I was told that overselling the flight was normal - ""all airlines do it"". The fact that all of them do it of course is not a justification nor explanation. I was casually advised to read the small print in the future. On the way back from my destination, in order to avoid the same thing happening, I decided to check in online 24 hours before. However, I was again denied a check in and was put on a stand by. Apparently, the return flight is overbooked again! I do not understand how it is possible that the product/service that I have purchased, I can not use. How can it be legal that the company has no responsibility to honour their contractual obligation to provide me the service that I have duly purchased a good 4 months in advance!!!!

"✅ Verified Review |  Heathrow to Dubai. This is a warning of what to expect from British Airways . If they continue to treat passengers this way I can see the airline very quickly getting into difficulty. The reply I got from the airline below just brushed all the issues I raised under the carpet. Living in Egypt for 10 years I became I frequent flyer with Egyptair. If I wanted to change the date of travel with them they only charged me £60. BA want to charge me over £500 and because I wanted to cancel my flight and go with a better airline they were only prepared to give me a £9.50 refund even though I would have given them over 2 months notice. This airline is on my black list, makes me ashamed to think this is my national airline, but never again will I book another flight with BA. There was no priority seat booking unless I paid another £38 extra. There was no priority boarding. I booked seat 23D but this was mysteriously changed at check in to 24E. BA emailed me to confirm a change in the booking but did not say what that change was. I did not make any changes. In premium economy I was wedged in like a sardine in a seat that is only 1"" wider than economy with a few inches extra leg room. Is this some kind of joke? I had to double check that I wasn't in economy as there is only one seat difference in a row. The tough chicken meal was diabolical. The cabin light over the bulkhead luggage bins was jammed on and would not go out so no sleep whatsoever. I really do not see the necessity for this light anyhow as the non smoking lights and tv screen light give emit sufficient light anyway.

"✅ Verified Review |  Shanghai to Tampa via Heathrow/Gatwick. We received deplorable customer service recently from British Airways. I purchased business class tickets on 11/28/2016 for flights on September 30, 2017. I purchased two tickets for a total of $9,676.26 plus an additional $652 for seat assignments. The problems occurred on our return flights. We were booked October 17, 2017 on BA168 Shanghai to LHR  London with continuing service, October 18, 2017 from London Gatwick)to Tampa. We were disembarking a cruise ship at the port of Shanghai on October 17, 2017. We checked in online 24 hours before our flights scheduled departure at 11:00 A.M. On the evening of October 16, 2017 the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at 7:00 A.M. In the morning on October 17, the Captain announced that the Chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock. After these announcements we frantically tried to contact British Airways because we expected that we would miss our 11:00 AM flight. We were unable to do so. We were informed that in order to exit China without a visa, we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country. We were aware of this requirement. We had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane. We knew that without a visa of valid flights out, we would be escorted to the local Chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country. For obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation. We were able to contact a travel agent via e-mail (our phone was not operating as we were at sea in Chin ). Our agent was able to contact British Airways and explain our situation. There was another flight that departed on October 18, which was 13 hours 40 minutes after our original flight. That was Flt BA 160. We were told here are your choices: 1. Pay a change fee of $884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights, BA 160 and BA 2167 , even though we would be able to make BA 2167 as it did not depart London (LGW) until 11:55 AM on October 18, 2017. 2. Pay an additional $6,388 per person for a total of $12,776 to keep our business class status on both flights. (We had already paid $10,328.26 for these tickets). 3. Disembark the ship and take our chances with Chinese immigration. Option 2 was outrageous, Option 3 frightening. We felt we had no choice but to choose Option 1. The travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check-in and request our business class seats if they were available. When we checked in at PVG we asked if there were business class seats available. “Yes, several” was the response. We explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats. “Yes, for a cost of $12,776 “. Of course we refused to pay that amount. We were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class, two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy. While on board during that flight BA160, I went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats. When we arrived in London we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats. Were we on the same flight as originally scheduled, but I was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers.

"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Marrakech. Generally a well organised flight and fairly full in Y class. My gripe is about the current food service. This was a fairly long short-haul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable. After a lot of comments from others who have flown BA recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the coho-ice on board is very limited, especially as much seems to be already 'sold out'. The biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling. It took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though I observed that about 60% of passengers bought nothing. Of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front, any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed. Passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which I assume was not welcomed by those passengers. I overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time. It is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long. I remember the days when a British Midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a LHR to Middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an Aer Lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from Dublin to London.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Sofia. Cabin crew were kind. This is the only positive thing. British Airways are now becoming as bad as Ryanair! Onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of money even for a small bottle of water. When I booked my flight from Heathrow to Sofia, I was told I get a free checked in bag for my baby girl. A day before my flight I decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the phone told me I need to pay for checked in bag if I want one. I told him that there should be one included for my baby daughter but he said this is not true. I asked him to double check this and he said he already did so I had to pay for a checked bag (£30 each way) since I already had my suitcase packed. Next day, as I went to the check in at Heathrow, I was asked how many bags do I want to check in. I asked how many bags am I allowed to check in and the lady said I can check in two bags- one for my baby and the one that I’ve paid for the previous day. The thing is that I only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me I can only check one bag (if I pay for it first). After I arrived in Sofia, I rang British airways and explained everything, so they agreed they should refund the money they’ve charged me for the additional bag. They said they’ll refund the £30 for the London-Sofia flight the same day and the other £30 fee for the Sofia-London route in about a week time. A month later I checked my online banking and saw they’ve only refunded £30 for the outbound journey. I rang them and they’ve said they are sorry and they’ll refund the remaining £30 within the next 3 days.

"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Nassau via Heathrow. British Airways is becoming a dismal airline to fly with. I will start with the worst and shocking aspect of my flight from Heathrow to Singapore on Oct 23. There were bugs on the flight and I have bites all over my body at least at a dozen places. One can suffer the bad food, service / behavior of cabin staff but having one's health compromised is unacceptable. The toilets were filthy. I was in the paid premium seat (front row) and I could smell the toilet from there. The attitude of staff ranges of sweet to indifferent and curt sometime for no rhyme or reason. The food is inconsistent and becomes a pain when you are on a long haul flight because there are no options available. While flying from Nassau to Heathrow, the dinner was fine but the breakfast (I think it was a morning snack), consisted of a croissant which was a cold lump, coffee which was cold and a oats snack bar. I mean, you cant get a croissant right? The inflight entertainment was mediocre at best and remains much to be desired. The screens in the Singapore- Heathrow sectors were ok to use but the Heathrow to Nassau sector were malfunctioning all the time. I could feel the fingers of the passengers sitting behind me trying to function the 'touch screen'; more like punch screen. The flights were mercifully on time and full marks for that this time.

"✅ Verified Review |  Pisa to Gatwick. I fly this route often as I have a home in Tuscany. Believe me it does not get any better - but the option is Ryanair and that's worse. Flight started in the new South Terminal lounge. The decor and layout of the facility is great. No problems here although it's located in a ""not so easy place"" to find. Breakfast food was ghastly. Cheap baps with greasy bacon or a dried up ""eggy"" thing. Horrible. Didn't touch it and those that did - left it as confirmed by numerous plates with half eaten baps. Had tinned fruit salad and yoghurt plus a G&T. Yes I know, bit early in the day! Short walk to the gate. Plane left on time. the usual horrible 3 for 2 seats in Club Europe. The front row made it easier - but only just. Had a pleasant lunch of chicken and couscous salad. The plane was very old. This was confirmed by the WC. Originally the loo flush button was blue. After 100,000 + uses the blue was partly eroded by finger presses, to a grey colour. The loo basin cannot be described here. Plane landed on time. The Captain came out and I had a nice chat with him. Very nice bloke. Return flight started in the shared lounge. It okay but can get busy. Same plane back (recognizable by the flush button in the loo - unless all the BA319s are like it). Skipped the meal as I'd eaten lunch in Pisa. It looked nice though. A few gin and tonics to suppress my irritation at what a shoddy product Club Europe is. Great flight back into the setting sun.

"✅ Verified Review |  Faro to Gatwick. Check in was quiet at the club Europe desk and I was very quickly booked in. Fast track security at the airport wasn’t particularly well managed, although I did get through quicker than I would have otherwise. Disappointingly British Airways do not provide any lounge access at Faro, and there is currently a lot of construction taking place in the main departure lounge, and the builders are not exactly considerate with the noise! There was no priority queue at the entrance to the gate and as usual British Airways did a fairly half hearted job at ensuring priority boarding of the aircraft itself. The aircraft was the new style, which I think is very smart and nicely decorated (not budget airline as some commentators like to say), and whilst the legroom isn’t amazing I am 6’ tall and was quite comfortable and having the extra table space makes it a more usable space. The cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficient. A bar service with nuts was delivered soon after take off along with the menu for the flight. All of the cold parts of the meal and the drinks were excellent, sadly the chicken main was quite overcooked leading to dry chicken and soggy veg. That being said it tasted very nice. Arriving into Gatwick was a dream, especially for a large airport. Although the buildings are quite old and not laid out as well as newer ones, they have done a fantastic job at modernising it and making security very quick. It took a little while for bags to reach the belt but priority bags all came out first so the process was fairly painless. I got a good deal on the flight so I would say it was reasonably good value for money, although the experience in Faro airport does reduce the premium feel considerably.",7,2017-10-20, United Kingdom ,False,review faro gatwick check quiet club europe desk quickly booked fast track security airport particularly well managed although get quicker would otherwise disappointingly british airway provide lounge access faro currently lot construction taking place main departure lounge builder exactly considerate noise priority queue entrance gate usual british airway fairly half hearted job ensuring priority boarding aircraft aircraft new style think smart nicely decorated budget airline commentator like say whilst legroom amazing tall quite comfortable extra table space make usable space cabin crew friendly professional whilst also efficient bar service nut delivered soon take along menu flight cold part meal drink excellent sadly chicken main quite overcooked leading dry chicken soggy veg said tasted nice arriving gatwick dream especially large airport although building quite old laid well newer one done fantastic job modernising making security quick took little bag reach belt priority bag came first process fairly painless got good deal flight would say reasonably good value money although experience faro airport reduce premium feel considerably

"✅ Verified Review |  Malaga to Gatwick. They've introduced new cabin baggage allowances. Ultimately that means everyone tries to jam their huge cases into the overhead lockers, resulting in a Ryanair-like scuffle. They now charge for food. This would be fine if it didn't take the single food trolley the entire duration of most short haul flights to get all the way down the plane. On my previous three flights with 'the new BA' we've been left for over an hour and a half (the last flight was actually over two hours) without any service. As the economy passengers are not allowed to use business class toilets, there was a long queue of passengers stuck behind the trolley desperately trying to get to the toilets at the back of the plane. On the other end of the trolley a whole bunch of passengers waiting for a scrap of food and drink two hours after take off. The cabin crew seem genuinely fed up. One of the key reasons for flying BA was their friendly cabin crew service. This has now been absolutely and totally undermined by the company, giving them no time (or energy, by the look of it) to be nice.

They said I had to pay approx £350 to buy a new single ticket home, even after I explained my situation. I argued that had I been informed that they had cancelled my flight 5 days ago when they did I could have at least bought a cheaper flight. Even the day before when I got the check in open message would have allowed me to book cheaper. Eventually the customer relations manager offered a ticket for £122 (charging me again for taxes). As i needed to get back and there was no time to go to Gatwick for cheaper flight I had no choice but to pay.

"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Orlando return. Worst ever long-haul Business Class flight.  We have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which British Airways have descended (not the world’s favourite airline by far). We have never liked BA’s Business Class (Club World) seats since they changed over to the Yin-Yang layout of 8 seats across the cabin. The seat layout together with the poor service, meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long-haul Business Class flight we have experienced. To this day I have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the CAA regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place. Unless you are sat in an aisle seat, cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculous. (True this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head!) In order to get out of the centre seats (rows E and F) and the window seats you have to climb over another passenger’s feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined. In the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous; as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over. We are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason. You almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly, often from behind you so by the time you notice them, they have gone. We should not have to use a call button just to get basic service. The return leg was a night flight, the service overall was very poor, the crew just wanted to turn the lights down ASAP. The service at breakfast was also poor, the offerings were inconsistent. My wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin, whereas I at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee. The entertainment system was archaic (very few recent film titles), the small screen resolution was very poor; this aircraft was delivered to BA in March 1999 and it shows its age. This flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service. BA are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them. It is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats, you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service. It will be marginally better than being seated at the back; but that does not make it right.

"✅ Verified Review |   Flew Leeds Bradford to Geneva via London Heathrow. British Airways certainly shocked me with the budget low cost style. My bag was 23.1 kg (0.1kg over the limit).

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Istanbul. British Airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers, even loyal ones who have status like myself. The overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline. Galleries South in T5 is large, airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the Sunday I travelled. Drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers - the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients. Onboard it is similarly tired, the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table. Seating is cramped. The cabin crew look dejected and have low morale. Onboard experience the service is no different, than flying easyJet, in fact I would argue worse. There is no complimentary catering, you are subjected to M&S sandwiches. It is not cheap and or good value or any better than LCC offerings. Service is slow and took the whole of 4.5 hours of the flight - meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle - I was even asked to wait until I was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people. The slow service is due to the use of card only payment, and also the fact the supplier doesn't allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down. On the return journey its clear BA doesn't care about its European or non-North American routes - the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar, in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy, but least the food was decent.

"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to London in Premium Economy and onto Oslo in Economy. Easy check in and in the lounge within 15 mins. The usual selection of dry sandwiches, and a chicken noodle soup (minus the chicken and noodle). The lounge was clean with plenty of staff clearing away. Efficient boarding with sparking wine/soft drinks offered. Early departure, fast drink service and dinner before lights out. There was no breakfast (previously scrapped) with the cereal bar now also gone. Early arrival, a short wait for a shower in the North Lounge, followed by an ok breakfast. An early departure and an average flight on a A319. Long queues for the bathroom (only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats) with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink. Early arrival though a long wait for bags. Oslo to London on a A320 was verging on a farce, A full flight, selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for space. The buy onboard came out quickly with one and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row served. Service ground to a halt whilst the crew tried to get either machine back into life, broke out the paper visa slips, took the cart back in, re-appeared 20 mins later so service started an hour into the flight. Little take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchases. The crew tried really hard, put a brave face on and kept going. The organisation and concept of the BA buy on board is a disgrace. Though a third party provides the food and card machines, the choice, stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce.  I don't understand why BA continue to struggle with this service as Easyjet, Ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act together. Early arrival and fast bags completed the flight. Final flight home to Toronto was good, the club lounge at the B gates remains quiet, clean and an oasis to relax and eat/drink before flying. The 787 was towed to the gate 45 mins before departure and was never going to leave on time. At the gate, the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business class. Service was really slow on boarding I had to ask for champagne, and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off. We pushed back over 30 late. No signs of life from crew for another 30 mins, though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart. The main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking (no dried gravy or potato around the edges). Afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic. Overall, the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements. The crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience. The desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times. Other than the farce of buy on board, I was pleased there appeared to be no further decline in service.

"✅ Verified Review |  Geneva to London. British Airways used to be my favourite airline, however, over the last 2 years I have experienced some appalling service in pretty much every flights I have had with them. I do fly with BA about 30 times a year. In this specific occasion my flight was cancelled for apparent adverse weather (this being in the middle of summer in a time where the weather was excellent in both my departure/arrival cities) I was told abput this the day before in the afternoon bearing in mind I was flying at 7am the morning after. Their communication was made via text including a number to call back to re arrange my flight. I must have call that number about 30 times without success as the lines were too busy. When I managed to connect I have had to hold for an hour before the line died. I have only managed to speak to them at 11pm that day when they told me they placed me on a flight 4.5 hours later. Horrible customer service by the way, the person I was talking to couldn't care less. I was originally flying in business and I was placed in economy instead. I was told that there was no compensation for the delay because it was due to the weather conditions (a lie of course as the weather was still amazing in both countries) and promised a refund on the fare which to date (about 4 months later) has still not happened.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to New York. After reading reviews I was hoping some were inaccurate, but after this flight in Club World I realise that BA has fallen even lower than many have said. Check in at T5 was interminably slow with one of the most arrogant staff I have encountered for years. The lounge was crowded and dirty, and the food selection is terrible for a premium facility. Onboard, seats are old and tatty, cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoever. The food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me, and what a lousy offering this was - below many airline economy meal standards. IFE screen was not working properly, fuzzy and very poor. Cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly, but they certainly hide in the galley as soon as they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight, they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these. Luckily, I am leaving the USA to Asia from Los Angeles next week on Eva Air and expecting a big step up in standards.

"✅ Verified Review |  Port of Spain to Gatwick via St. Lucia was a good experience. I don't have any complaints regarding the seat quality or flight attendants, who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passengers safe and serving meals and drinks. The seat was comfortable enough, a bit wider than on low cost flights, I had extra space and as I noticed the leg room between seats was regular. I had a seat behind the bulkhead with enough leg room. There was a minor issue, the flight had a stop at St. Lucia, after which the new flight attendants insisted on waking up the people on the front row, opened their entertainment system screens, to show them the safety video which was shown about an hour and a half on take off from Port of Spain. I told them it's not necessary to view the video again and actually the video was not available this time, so this would be something the management should look into. In-flight entertainment was good, with no advertising, which pleased me a lot. I had a jolly passenger next to me in the middle seat, who had a bit too much to drink and moved a lot in the seat, sometimes talked louder than necessary, but he was still fun to have around and the flight attendants made sure in a very polite and funny way that he does not disturb the other passengers. There were minor issues during check-in at the departure airport in Port of Spain, the BA staff forgot to put a priority tag on my bag and give me a voucher for the lounge as I have a gold card on Oneworld. To use the lounge I had to use my Priority Pass not to waste time until the matter was cleared with the ground staff. I was flying further from Gatwick to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines, hoping I would not have to change airports in London and as a result go through immigration, take the baggage out, check-in again, pass immigration and security again, but BA doesn't have an agreement with Turkish Airlines and I had to go through this lengthy process.",5,2017-09-26, Romania ,False,review port spain gatwick via st lucia good experience complaint regarding seat quality flight attendant good job flight keeping passenger safe serving meal drink seat comfortable enough bit wider low cost flight extra space noticed leg room seat regular seat behind bulkhead enough leg room minor issue flight stop st lucia new flight attendant insisted waking people front row opened entertainment system screen show safety video shown hour half take port spain told necessary view video actually video available time would something management look flight entertainment good advertising pleased lot jolly passenger next middle seat bit much drink moved lot seat sometimes talked louder necessary still fun around flight attendant made sure polite funny way disturb passenger minor issue check departure airport port spain ba staff forgot put priority tag bag give voucher lounge gold card oneworld use lounge use priority pas waste time matter cleared ground staff flying gatwick istanbul turkish airline hoping would change airport london result go immigration take baggage check pas immigration security ba agreement turkish airline go lengthy process

"✅ Verified Review |  I flew from London Heathrow to Sofia and back. The plane on both flights was an Airbus 321 and I’d guess a young one judging by the freshness of the interior. I am 1.82m (6 feet) tall and found the leg room and seat width to be fine – I certainly didn’t feel cramped even in the centre seat. Both flights departed the gate on schedule (although actual take-off on the outbound flight was slightly delayed because of air traffic restrictions over Europe). The cabin crew on both legs were pleasant and courteous. On both flights, the captain kept us very well informed of our route and our progress. So far, top marks to British Airways but where they let themselves down is the shambles of a refreshment service. It might seem like a minor gripe but I do like the opportunity to get something to eat or drink on a flight even if I have to pay for it (which you do not on other legacy airlines like Lufthansa). The range and prices of food and drink on offer were comparable with low cost airlines I have flown with. But there the comparison ends because whilst I have always been served quickly (and sometimes twice) on short haul low-cost airlines, BA’s service is too slow and seems to run out of stock too. They also insist on card only transactions. I had the misfortune to be sitting toward the rear of the plane on both legs - and the A321 is a long plane. A single trolley started from the front, making ponderous progress towards me and even though the flight was two hours and forty minutes long, I only just managed to get a coffee and sandwich from a slightly harried flight attendant who by now had returned the trolley and was scuttling to and from the galley, squeezing past the long queue of passengers waiting for the lavatories. (The coffee, by the way, was excellent). The return flight was worse because the trolley made it two thirds down the aisle and was getting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley, leaving the remaining passengers unserved.

"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Mauritius. Very disappointing airline and service. The facing each other seats are fun theoretically but when reality hits, it's a mess. Why? Because you get other people stumbling on your feet during mid-flight. Or is it just my luck and most the other passengers on business class were old and not flexible enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you mid-sleep every time they need to use the restroom? The TV monitors colors are so off. it was a nightmare trying to enjoy any movie. Getting the brightness right to make the colors work. Because if you don't want the monitor to blind you when it's snooze time, good luck watching the movie in any other color than black and red. The worst thing was the food - salad was frozen. The beef filet was so dry and flavorless but too salty. My partner's chicken was swimming in a pool of oil and flavorwise, it was hitting all the wrong spots. They believe in Umami and dump a ton of MSGs on their food to make it taste edible but did they get that wrong. I ended up eating bread and butter only. Same goes for the scrambled eggs for breakfast. Bacon was extra salty.  And the fresh fruit bowl was just as frozen as the salad. Overall, very poor and disappointing experience.

✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to London. I am a regular BA flyer and so generally my expectation is low nowadays as they almost become a Tier 2 airline. The journey started in the Concorde lounge Dubai and it is a very small area with little food that in the two hours I was there was not refreshed. Onboard the 777 you begin to sense the jobs worth attitude of the staff who seem to permanently work to rule. Amazingly when the menu came it contained only an Arabic snack with no options. They say this is to allow maximum sleep. No other airline has done this. Breakfast was undercooked slop and it was inedible. It is incredible that you can spend 10000 usd on a ticket and you can't even get a meal. The airline is clearly failing fast and I wish now I had flown the luxury of Emirates at half the price.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Funchal. In my opinion British Airways have got things badly wrong in the race to the bottom. For travellers in Economy BA are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that. They have failed to understand what their true market is all about. Generally if people want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the likes of Ryanair or Easyjet. The BA brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides, but sadly not any more. The choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it's expensive. Frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay. And that assumes that from the enormous range of 2 types of sandwich on offer that there will be any left. On our flights to and from Funchal there was a single trolley for the entire economy cabin, in each case taking more than 2 hours to make it from the front to the back. Service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink! Maybe that's in the next part of the BA master plan?! British Airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embarrassment, not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier, simply lost somewhere in the middle. As a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away. Don't BA management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for 'free' food and drink? Sadly I think we know the answer. All we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete.",9,2017-09-11, United Kingdom ,False,review london gatwick funchal opinion british airway got thing badly wrong race bottom traveller economy ba another budget carrier good one failed understand true market generally people want use cheap budget carrier use like ryanair easyjet ba brand always associated quality full service airline provides sadly choice food sale economy passenger poor expensive frankly must embarrassing cabin crew make announcement saying business class passenger offered hot meal free drink economy must pay assumes enormous range type sandwich offer left flight funchal single trolley entire economy cabin case taking hour make front back service could slower crew trying sell scratch card along overpriced food drink maybe next part ba master plan british airway used national carrier proud day embarrassment full service airline decent budget carrier simply lost somewhere middle fairly regular traveller many year preference would always travel national airline race bottom driving away ba management understand many people would gladly pay little bit free food drink sadly think know answer need bugle playing plane touch sad transition world class carrier poor budget imitator complete

"✅ Verified Review |  Flew British Airways from Belfast City to London Heathrow. First time I flew from Belfast and it's a great little airport. I had access to the BA lounge, which for such a small airport is pretty good. It was an evening flight and there were a decent choice of cold sandwiches including: chicken, smoked salmon, egg, etc. The bar was well stocked including Fever Tree tonic and Grey Goose vodka. Champagne was available on request. Due to a flight delay our plane did not depart from the air bridge, but at gate 6, but we could access this gate using stairs from the lounge, this was managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding was announced in the main terminal. The flight was probably at 30% capacity so the FA had no problems serving passengers. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we made some time and was at the gate at Heathrow 20 minutes late.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver. I booked our trip with them as the price was unbeatable. Our outward flight to Vancouver was delayed by approx an hour. We were seated on the top deck and I was impressed by the room we had (window/Aisle and 3 middle seats). The crew were great with our young sons offering them extra drinks, pillows etc. Food was OK (the kids Mac cheese was better than the adult meals). Entertainment was good and flight was smooth most of the way. On our return flight we again had a delay of about an hour but 45 mins of that was made up thanks to a strong tail wind. Again we were on the top deck and it was so quiet up there it was lovely. Food was again just ok. We had an incident where my son spilt a bottle of Fanta all over himself midflight when everyone was asleep. He was drenched and I had no spare clothes for him. I spoke to a wonderful member of crew who couldn't be more helpful. She found some first class PJs for him to change into and gave him a couple of extra goodies and she checked up on us a few times after that commenting how good he had been throughout the flight.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Sao Paulo. An exceptionally ordinary flight, both for good and for bad. Cabin crew were disinterested -- I was made to feel intrusive when I asked at the galley for a glass of water between dinner and breakfast service -- something I'd never felt before. I felt somewhat snubbed when, after asking for help (being short) loading my (exit-row) hand luggage into the OHLs the FA took heed of an older woman telling him her bag had ""two tablets in and is fragile"" so should be stacked on top of mine, and didn't bother to ask me about the contents of my bag -- my laptop speakers haven't worked since. I slept through dinner service, but was awake for the standard disappointment of a breakfast. A continental/charcuterie option would go down a treat on this route, I imagine, but we had a choice of flaccid English breakfast or flaccid omelette.

"✅ Verified Review |  On a flight from Bangkok to London and you'll have some locals and holiday makers that wish to have a taste of Thailand in their meal choices. First meal service has Thai Green Curry (veg) and the second Thai Red Curry (chicken). Really? No one could come up with two Thai dishes that were a little bit more different? So the meal service begins and I was going to have the chicken satay starter and main course salad with grilled prawns. Unfortunately the chicken satay dish has been replaced by a prawn dish which turns out to be every ingredient from the chicken satay apart from the chicken and obviously with prawns.  I said, ""I don't want the prawns for starter as I'm having the prawn main meal."" I should not have worried as the prawn salad was off.  Ok so prawns for starter and I'll have garlic herb crusted chicken breast with onion sauce, mashed potatoes, mushroom, spinach and tomato. Well I'm not sure how they did it but the potatoes were disgusting to the point I wasn't eating them. The chicken breast was dry and I got no hint of herb or garlic or chicken to be honest and the onion sauce could not save it even if there had been enough of it. Mushrooms were very meh, tomato and spinach were fine but all in all inedible. The bread roll didn't win any prizes either. I just gave up and refused to eat it. Now when this was served I'd been drinking rose champagne and wanted a glass of chardonnay but the FA was off too quickly. No problem, press the call bell. Which is reset before anyone comes. Press it again and think I'd better get on with eating my food. Eventually some one arrives and notices I'm not eating my main course and after I tell them it is disgusting I ask why no one has answered my call button. Obviously I'm just asked what did I want and I say it was the wine but it is a bit too late now and I'll have port instead as cheese and crackers will be my next choice. This does not appear for fifteen minutes. During that time I am offered the vegetable thai green curry to replace my inedible main but that isn't going work for me. So a couple of hours later I'm a bit peckish and go to raid the club kitchen where I find some quite pleasant snacks. Back at my seat I think I need a G&T with this but ten minutes later no one has arrived or even been in our cabin. There is no one in the galley galley between the two club world cabins and indeed no member of staff in the larger CW cabin. I do find one in the second galley. I ask and my call button is tested and appears to be working but three times I've tried to use it and been ignored. Bad service. Now on to the second meal service. Strangely there appears to be no choice unlike stated in the menu. I ask the FA about this but am just told everyone is having the same, no explanation. The starter turns out to be smoked salmon with a wasabi dressing. The dressing is tasteless but salmon is fine. Now this is a pity because my choice of main was going to be a meze that had smoked salmon as a major part and now I have to choose again. Ok main meal, I'm give a choice of smoked salmon again or red Thai curry so no choice really and I decide to give up and go to a restaurant when I disembark.

On the return Club flight in particular, the purser told us on the tannoy that staffing levels were low so service would be slower; on 3 occasions I had to ask for a G&T, eventually I only received it by going to the galley. It was made clear by the staff that they resented my interrupting their jokes and conversation. Food in club was average.

The flights were smooth and left on time, seating fairly comfortable, consider is was a 80 minute flight. Pre-board and on board announcements were efficient and informative. The downside however, was the in flight food and drinks service which was in disarray. Although BA on European routes have also opted for charging for virtually everything that low cost carriers do, I still expected some efficiency. It was tediously slow, with the attendants pacing up and down the isles to get an item not in the trolley. The glossy M&S menu looked good, but too laborious to get some food and pay for it. With some families split up, paying for items took longer, with some getting impatient and noisy. By the time the trolley reached the back of the aircraft, the descent had already begun.

White fish consisted of 3 tiny pieces of 'fish' surrounded by a brown, fatty unidentifiable, flavourless mass. The tiny token broccoli was a greenish brown mush. Service was efficient, bordering on perfunctory. Luckily we brought some other food on board.

"✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Gatwick. Check in was easy thanks to fast help from the check-in desk. The staff at the gate were friendly and ensured boarding did not take a huge amount of time. The welcome on board was exceptional, however the cabin crew service was quite regular for the remainder of the flight (ie, nothing exceptional or poor). The seats looked very appealing, but the seams at the point where the upright and horizontal parts of the seat meet are out of line and make it slightly uncomfortable to sit on after a while. This is a great shame for a good looking cabin. We took off twenty minutes after the intended time, due to a late start to boarding and an extended taxi time. However, the pilots did a great job in keeping us informed to the reason for the delay, and the current progress in making up the lost time.

"✅ Verified Review |  Florence to Bristol. A positive first experience and I will try to fly BA in the future. When I booked the flight for myself and my 11 and 13 year olds I was automatically allocated seats (no charge), 23kg of checked luggage included at no additional charge yet the flights still worked out the cheapest. A few hours before the flight, during online check-in, I noticed my daughter's name mispelt on the ticket. I telephoned BA's 24 hour helpline and the ticket was changed and reissued within an hour and I received a call back with an update part way through the process (no charge and no hassle). All staff from customer services to ground staff to in-flight crew were friendly. Staff on the return flight went out of their way to try and help a young mum with an upset child. We were given a meal with water and a further drink on our 2h 20m flight. On this flight to Bristol everything is included in your ticket. We had soft drinks but a couple in-front had G&Ts. Our meal was salmon with couscous, bread, cheese and a mint. On the way back there was a choice of falafel and couscous or chicken salad with a chocolate brownie. The meals were actually really nice. Both our flights did depart late for different and, what I believe were, unavoidable reasons but we were given adequate explanations and our flight out to Italy still arrived early. Some explanation before boarding the return flight might have been helpful although nobody seemed concerned and it was passengers who hadn't got themselves to the gate that further held the flight up. I wasn't bothered which airline I flew with. My criteria were that I could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and BA came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flight.

No smiles from crew as busy doing math on what they are selling. Not even a flight map to help pass time. Terrible airline.

Flight delayed, that happens I accept, but the BA ground staff handling was awful - to the point of zero in reality. Once boarded and fighting for overhear bin space, pilot did give a polite and nice apology, but the cabin staff service (that has always been their stronger point) was terrible. Aside from the fact 2 stewards smelt as if they had poured a complete bottle of aftershave over their heads (most unpleasant in a confined space), their service to us lowly passengers was condescending and rude. They seemed intent with making stupid faces and snide comments about some passengers in full hearing of many of us, and that is just not acceptable. Sadly they were almost stationary in the aisle trying to sell food and drinks and we had to suffer long periods of such rudeness. BA management should be fired, or at least the CEO, Mr Cruz, who is destroying our national airline.

"✅ Verified Review |  Toulouse to London Heathrow. This airline will one day get its comeuppance for posing as a quality flag carrier (it has to be said, no expense is spared on its branding) while operating as a cheap and sleazy budget airline, thanks to the rationale of its greedy and cynical new management. I have Bronze status with BA Executive Club, have flown a dozen times over the past year (both in Business and in Economy) and am increasingly irritated with myself that I chose to collect points with this particular airline. I was caught up in the IT meltdown in May (flying from Rhodes to London), and I was one of the lucky ones (who doesn't remember those surreal news reports of passengers stranded all over the world for 4 days?). I had to purchase a new ticket on a charter flight from Rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled (along with hundreds of other BA flights in May); this (incidentally: ghastly TUI) replacement flight arrived so much later than the flight I booked that I lost my pre-paid hotel booking at the airport, which the airline refused to refund when I lodged a claim. The airline only refunded me for my cancelled flight and my new flight, along with EU compensation, after I sent a second email a month after my first claim, as they simply neglected to raise a cheque for me, according to the customer agent. Their customer service is beyond atrocious. I suspect they swear company oaths never to genuinely apologise for BA failings (all you get is ""bear with us, we're trying really hard""), lest actually saying sorry should incur legal liability. I am unfortunately due to fly with them again at the end of the month to Belfast, and after two calls to their contact center (based in India, with a poor connection and amateur communication overall) still do not know if my travel companion will be allowed to travel on a domestic flight as a Canadian citizen without a UK ID document. The customer agents I spoke to gave me contradictory answers, which, in turn, run contrary to the (almost non-existent) information provided on their website. On the flights I have booked which have actually taken place, I have by turns found myself stuck along with fellow passengers on the tarmac for an hour and a half in BDX when the plane lost its takeoff spot, having waited for delayed passengers (would they admit this was their fault? Nope, it was all air traffic control's fault!), been held on the tarmac in TLS for an hour whilst they sorted out luggage which had mistakenly been put on our plane, retrieved a used bottle of rancid baby milk from my Club seat (no apology from the flight attendant who seemed annoyed at having to handle it), sat in a seat totally encrusted in potato chips apparently used as confetti by a previous passenger and found myself wedged between totally drunken and abusive passengers in Club and a scolding flight attendant threatening to have them arrested on arrival.

"✅ Verified Review |  London City to Dusseldorf return, flights operated on behalf of BA by Eastern Airways. The cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases. Cabin Crew must of been members of the Basil Fawlty school of Catering. The outward flight there were 3 passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out to the three of us. The young stewardess took our orders, then we heard a crash as the young stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told us that the aircraft only had two meals and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal. The meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented. On arrival at Dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal. The arrivals boards in the airport say terminal B and we were dropped off at Terminal C. Our delivered to terminal C and we had to walk to Terminal B if you were been met. The return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that BA is becoming famous for at overseas airports. Check in did not open until 90 minutes before the fight to LCY and 2 hours before the flight to LHR. I can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf. As the flight to LCY may only have max 100 pax and they would of been able to see the flight loading the day before. The check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on Club Europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle. Which looked totally out of place in uniform. The flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals, which meant that 3 passengers were offered a so called Ham & Chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days. Again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has Wizz and Ryanair, in fact they have better staff than Eastern Airways so these crews maybe the one who have failed these airlines selection process.  I was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills these crews displayed. On arrival at LCY it become apparent that the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the region of 8 passengers case behind. The handling agents at LCY could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flight. I did phone on Monday evening and a gave more details of the contents of the case to them which they did update on the system. This morning I spoke to a member of senior management at Dussledorf Airport. About 4 hours after this call the bags had been found in the baggage handling area at the airport.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. I am a BA Gold member and reserved three BA business class tickets to Chicago returning from Denver. I selected contiguous seats so that my young daughters and myself would sit together. A week before departure, I received a message from BA informing me that our flight was cancelled and that we were moved to an earlier flight on the same day. On the departure date, we checked smoothly at the business class counter at LHR. The fast track boarding pass reader let us through without a problem. The lounge attendant, however, curtly dismissed us as having economy class boarding passes. I checked and it was true, but I had not suspected it at all till that point, since I had paid for business class, believed that everything was in order and was not told otherwise at check-in. The customer service agent at the lounge told me that there was nothing he could do since it wasn’t him who downgraded the ticket! I spoke to the manager who apologized and tried to search for seats on subsequent flights, but they were all full. He could not confirm if BA had any intention of compensating us for the downgrade, he had no explanation for why BA did not give us any other option with business seats despite canceling the flight a week in advance, nor did he acknowledge that BA had made any mistake in this ordeal. However, he did contact the crew and informed them of the situation. We ended up traveling in economy class. To add insult to injury, the airline was unable to place us next to each other, so the family was split (seven rows apart). However, the crew was nice and allowed us to leave the aircraft first.

"✅ Verified Review |  Nice to London Heathrow. I had to fly to Nice and back for work. Booked through the Company travel Agency. Extra bag added both ways. I wanted to fly back to LHR earlier so my Travel Agent rebooked the earlier flight at a cost of 371 GBP. When I arrived at NCE the Ground Staff refused to acknowledge the extra bag, saying that it was for the earlier flight. I stood my ground, but the Head of Check in told me if I wanted to fly I had to pay 75 EUR which I did under duress. I had prebooked my seat as Silver to find out at the gate that it had been changed to a middle seat which I loathe as the 767 is claustrophobic. I asked for my bags to be offloaded and I would travel on the next flight as is my right to do so there was a standoff at the gate.  The trend for BA in their spiral to the bottom is to outsource Check in Staff who have no comprehension of the BA system, combined with an arrogant ignorance that means I will not be choosing this airline again. I have one more flight with them next week and that's it.

"✅ Verified Review |  Unimpressed! Service very indifferent, impression that it's only a job by flight crew with no smiles on this flight. Perfunctory service at best! Guess this maybe all you can expect when you fly economy. British Airways calls their economy 'World Traveller', I wonder if those 'at the top' making decisions have travelled the world and are aware of the (much) superior service (most) other airlines offer even in economy? BA take a page from Qantas to see what economy service looks like. My understanding is BA recently lost a star, and are now only 3 stars. Quite understandable from what was offered on this flight! Food, awful, dinner of chicken, rice and peas. Breakfast over Ireland was a cream filled bun and granola bars, awful! Even a recent United flight from SYD to SFO served better meals! No return of crew to offer more beverages. And no service of water during the flight which most airlines constantly offer. The wine offering was the best part, a reasonably good Spanish Pinot Gris! There are alternatives to the UK from Canada, Air Canada, Air Transat, Westjet. On Westjet, you purchase your food, but I'm sure it has to be superior to BA's offering! My last flight to Britain on Air Canada was much superior. Air France last October to Paris was excellent! Qantas to Australia, is always brilliant! The only redeeming factor on this flight was the Airbus 380, still the smoothest and quietest plane flying!

"✅ Verified Review |  British Aurways was once one of the best airlines in the world, well known for outstanding inflight service, decent food, comfortable seats, good entertainment and a level of professionalism unequalled by many other airlines. How times have changed! Under recent CEOs, most notably the current holder the post, Alex Cruz, BA has declined to the level of a budget airline. In fact, I've had superior travel experiences on some budget carriers. Flying from Vancouver to London on the A380 was superb, it's a wonderful aircraft. Beyond that - atrocious. Dinner was a tough piece of chicken, over cooked vegetables and dried up rice. Breakfast was a farce, a dry bun with a smearing of cream cheese and a granola bar. Hardly suitable breakfast fare. The entertainment options were far inferior to what they used to be and the crew were unsmiling, disinterested and inattentive throughout the flight. No snacks, no water offering between meals; nothing! On the same route, Air Canada is superior in every way.

"✅ Verified Review |  British Airways is quickly becoming a low quality, low cost services, but premium priced airline. Apart from removing food from their services and replacing it with Marks & Spencer buy-on-board menu, on that particular flight, they even managed to run out of food for those who were willing to pay. It was impressive to see so many passengers having and expressing the same opinion: next time we'll just fly another airline, that reflects that quality of service into the ticket prices.

"✅ Verified Review |  Catania to Gatwick. About 30min after the plane took off the food trolley was wheeled up to the club class curtain and staff man had the task of selling all the leftovers from the outbound flight. It took 2 hours for the trolley to reach row 24 (our row) there was no food left not even a Kit-Kat we had the last can of Coca Cola and a bottle of water. Several factors contributed to this silly situation : BA Trying to become a low cost airline (I did not realise that it had sunk so low when I booked). The fact that only some card transaction could be used to pay.  The blocking of the aisle for long periods resulted in the trolley spending more time being pushed up and down the aisle to let passengers get to the loo and back than it did selling.

"✅ Verified Review |  Venice to Gatwick. Problems encountered on 24th July at Venice Marco Polo airport as a result of cancellation of flight BA2581 back to Gatwick. From various conversations that took place, it would appear that there were no British Airways staff at Venice Marco Polo airport; everything is handled by the local service agents. Obviously many of the problems are as a result of mishandling by the local service agents, they need to be made aware and re-trained if necessary as no doubt BA are paying them money to carry out their duties.  Announcements were unclear especially in the lounge, the departure board information did not help. After arriving at 13:00 we were eventually taken by bus to a hotel almost 1 hour away, arriving at 24:00.

"✅ Verified Review | The London Heathrow to Accra flight is regularly late leaving LHR by 1 -2 hours (as a regular on this route for 18 years I have spent many hours delayed at LHR). Started well with BA at last choosing a gate where they can process excess hand luggage prior to the final gate check (gate 27 - rather than the far gates at T3) - hand luggage is a problem on this sector. All looked good until the gate crew lost control of the gate on seeing the door to the jetway open passengers surged forward and then blocked the entrance while the calls made for First, Gold, Business etc to come forward. It is not pleasant to have to to push forward to get to the gate as a BA premium passenger. One First class passenger told the gate assistant to ""take control back of the gate"". She blamed the passengers when actually it was just poor gate management by the staff. It was a miracle then that the flight departed on time and arrived into Accra a little early. A first for me in 18 years on the route! Once on board the crew on the top deck could not have been more friendly. A shame then for them that they have such a poor product to work with - poor food, poor seats in a layout that defies any sense, lousy cheap amenity kit and finally an inflight entertainment package that does not change month after month.

"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Orlando return. Possibly the worst pre and post flight experience I can remember. 4 hrs late on the way out, almost three hours late on the return journey. BAs use of old aircraft is to blame. A failed IFE that couldn't be repaired took two hours to try and remedy. After this failed, a replacement plane was required. By the time this arrived, BA realised their crew could not fly due to exceeding their hours. This led to a further 1hr delay waiting for a standby crew. This was avoidable and shows the lack of genuine care pre flight by BA. No refreshments provided, no accurate information, just endless waiting. They didn't board the children first and it was a total mess. The plane could not land due to bad weather and had to divert to Tampa due to low fuel. Whilst this seems fair enough, the plane was actually 1hr late leaving Gatwick in the first place so had it left on time, it might have landed fine and passengers would not have encountered as long a delay as we did.

"✅ Verified Review |  San Diego to London Heathrow. The worst business class I have flown in! I flew on the 777 so whilst it's not the newest plane in the fleet, I still expected some level of comfort. The seats are too narrow and do not lie flat. I'm a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seat. There is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed, but does not line up with the rest of the seat. So your feet are raised. The armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around. Every time the person next to you moves, your chair moves too. The hydraulics must be connected. It was very annoying. The tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest, it sloped down and so drinks/meal tray did not stay put. It was not secure and basically, was flimsy and unusable. I had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap. I was in seat 14A which was a rear facing window seat. There is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you (which is a forward facing aisle seat). The divider has to stay down until you are airbourne. So for the first 40 minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding, you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face. Very awkward! The tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldn't stay put. It wanted to go back into the column and so I had to watch my movie at an angle. The food. Well. The fillet streak was tough and dry. I had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with American Airlines and they did a much better job. The selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice. Service: if you want good service, don't get a window seat. You are cut off from the aisle, and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger, the cabin crew forget you are even there. I had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round, both with dinner and breakfast. The layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head! Not ideal with some turbulence. There was also no wifi even though BA advertise as such. Apparently the Boeing 777 does not have the right equipment. In short, BA have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin. The layout is impractical, seats are narrow, there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger, and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored. The 777 is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly, the TV's stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal.

Flew British Airways from Pisa to London Gatwick. The two of us arrived at the airport exactly two hours before departure. We had hand baggage only and had already checked-in online and had boarding cards on our smartphones so proceeded to security. The queue was pretty hectic and it took 30 minutes to get through. Although we were flying Economy as BA Gold members we had access to the lounge. The lounge was quite dated in design but very comfortable with a good selection of food and beverage for a contract lounge. We left the lounge 45 minutes before the scheduled departure as still had to go through passport control, the queue was long and slow and took 20 minutes to get through. Once through we headed to the gates which was boarding for priority passengers. We received the magic beep and were upgraded to Club Europe (both of us are Gold members). We were seated in row 7, it was the typical 3 seats but the middle seat blocked with a tray installed. Leg room not great but we are both short. After take off we were offered drinks. I had a glass of champagne which was served from a full size bottle. We were then offered afternoon tea, consisting of three finger sandwiches: beef, egg and tuna and a slice of Victoria sponge cake. All very tasty but I do miss the scones in Club Europe. I also managed two top ups of champagne. The cabin crew were efficient and friendly enough and happy to provide extra drinks when requested.

"✅ Verified Review |  This was a one way Avios redemption flight. Fare cost £17.50 and 7,500 Avios each. As a BA Gold member I used the First class wing at T5, this included direct access to the Galleries First lounge. We were through very quickly as there was no queue at security. The lounge was busy and we arrived at the switch over from breakfast to lunch. The former had better food offering, the sausages and mushrooms very tasty. Lunch wasn't very good, I ordered a BA burger, the chips were the best part but only five were given on the plate, my wife ordered the aranchini which was awful and tasteless - she left most of it. The buffet selection wasn't particularly interesting, some chicken, potatoes, veggie curry and chilli. My wife said the curry was okay but the chilli I tried was bland. The drinks on offer were decent, a gin festival was on, although I don't drink the stuff the choice looked extensive. I had a few glasses of Henriot champagne which was okay better than the awful Castlenau they used to have but not as good as the Taittinger they served a year ago. I tried a few sips of a Kiwi Pinot Gris, can't remember what it was called but it was very nice. Finally I couldn't resist a shot of Johnnie Walker Blue. The first class lounge itself needs some TLC, the gents are smelly and unkept and none of the plug sockets worked. I normally try to fly another Oneworld airline other than BA. But if it has to be BA then I prefer to fly from T3 for the excellent Cathay Pacific lounge. In fact I prefer the new BA Gatwick First lounge than the Galleries T5. The flight itself was okay, it pushed back slightly late and arrived at Bologna on time. I didn't bother with the BoB as had eaten in the lounge and was saving myself for dinner in Bologna. Cabin crew seemed friendly enough and spent quite a long time selling the BoB offering. We sat in a pair of two seats next to door 3L. Really appreciated just two seats without any neighbours on the almost full flight. Due to our seat position in the plane and the fact both front and rear doors were used for deplaning, we were one of the last passengers to exit. It was a short bus ride to the terminal and it took 20 minutes to get though passport control then a further 30 minute wait for our luggage.

"✅ Verified Review |  Barcelona to Boston via London. Mixed review: we had to rebook suddenly for next-day business class because my wife broke a bone in her shoulder and had to go home urgently. BA cut us no slack for the injury and the change cost a fortune. The good: flight crews were wonderfully supportive and helpful; food was surprisingly good; wheelchair attendants at LHR were wonderful. The bad: A321 business class was an economy seat with slightly increased pitch and the middle seat blocked; Boeing 777 business class seats were very comfortable, but a seat in the middle of the 4-seat central block allowed no access to the aisle if the aisle passenger had the seat flattened or was using the footrest; LHR connection of 2 hr was barely enough for terminal 3 to 5 transfer (BA representative said 1 hr would be adequate!) - even with a wheelchair that allowed priority through security and transfer bus.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Brussels return. Through work I have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a BA flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed, even in the premium cabins. If your timing is right the prices reflect this, that is before the “add-on’s”. So be prepared to get on last, be prepared to be given the middle seat on the last or second to last row, and eat and drink before you board – unless of course you are happy to pay more. That way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up, it’s a win. Any flights longer than a couple of hours I strenuously avoid BA if I can - a shame because in some ways I grew up with BA (back in the days of BOAC and BEA).

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Accra. Flight left nearly two hours late - bit of an explanation but was really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure. This is always a busy flight with passengers taking on loads of cabin bags. Ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with 20 mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage. Chaos in economy class. On this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than 1 hr to departure. When will BA realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board - it is the most delayed flight out of Heathrow because of this poor management. Fact. The ground staff did nothing to control the crowds - simple and polite requests would have helped. The grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers - on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite (even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers). Once on board the crew were friendly and professional. Very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment, poor food and very poor quality seats. The cold/salad options are far better than the hot offering in BA's club class. Still no wi-fi on BA?

It was an evening weekday flight,so everyone tired & hungry. Their new M&S service was a disaster. The flight was just over 2 hours. It took 1 hour for the single food trolley to make its way to my row. By the time it arrived all that was available was a KitKat and some other sweets! They had already run out of sandwiches / hot food. It took a long time because each customer had to pay using credit card - and the machine seemed to keep on having problems. Also the variety on the new M&S menu - whilst generally a good thing - meant the staff kept on running back to the galley to replenish (clearly still not enough stored).

"✅ Verified Review |  Venice to Gatwick. I am done with British Airways. It has the worst service and incredibly rude staff. We were supposed to fly back from Venice at 11.55 p.m on 10th July. The flight was delayed by an hour and a half. BA policy indicates that there will be no food vouchers or otherwise for flight delays of less than two hours. Fair enough. However, what this does not take into account is the timing of the flight or the airport. The only cafe at the VCE Airport available to customers after security was shutting at around 11.30pm. When I went to buy some water, the guy at the counter refused outright.  Another lady had been there since 11 am (her flight earlier that day was delayed) and she went around the same time to redeem her food voucher. The guy shouted at her and called a guard on duty who was of no help and was incredibly rude. My partner tweeted about this to BA and there was no response from them at all although they were complimenting on someone's pics at the same time. We finally found a vending machine and there was no water there too. There was not one person from British Airways this whole time till 1am in the morning.  As if this wasn't enough, when boarding started and we were showing our tickets, we were told that that was the priority boarding line and the one next to us was for regular joes like us. We were the tenth/twelfth people from the front in the queue and the other queue was moving parallel to us. There was no sign or announcement separating the two queues. Instead of politely mentioning that, this member of BA staff shouts at us for everyone to hear and asks us to go to the back of the line. By then the so-called priority boarding was over so both the queues were meant for everyone. When I mentioned this, she told me that I was cutting the queue and wasting her time. We just moved aside and waited for everyone else to board before we did. I am definitely never going to choose BA again.

"✅ Verified Review |  After flying Boston to London on the A380-800, I returned on a recently retrofitted Boeing 747-400. The 747 seats were newer and much more comfortable than those from my previous flights (they appeared to be the same ones in the economy section on the A380). The seatback TV and in-flight entertainment had been significantly upgraded. The only part of the cabin's aesthetics and comfort that was lacking was the overhead lights, which hadn't been replaced. The cabin crew was polite, professional, and accommodating – no complaints there. The captain even gave us a personal, genuine announcement before takeoff, which was appreciated given the amount of preparation necessary before a long-haul flight. The flight itself was comfortable at 6 hours, 59 minutes, and without delay on either end.

"✅ Verified Review |  Naples to Gatwick. I used to admire and love BA. I now no longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate it. I think that one is entitled to have pleasant expectations when paying the not inconsiderable supplement for flying Club Europe. My wife and I have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two years, have complained (and received some Avios in compensation) but, this time, the cup overfloweth, unfortunately not with blessings. We had, once again (!) been allocated aisle seats in separate rows even though my wife’s preference states that she likes a window seat – and there were plenty of seats adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online changes so we did manage to get seats next to each other – but why does BA have to keep doing this? The trip as such started well enough in the new BA South Terminal Lounge, which was spacious and had a good selection of drinks, food and magazines. When time came for boarding and, amongst others, Club Europe passengers were invited to board first, there was no check made at all, which resulted in an almighty scrum as just anybody pushed forward immediately, exacerbated by then having to stand cooped up in the stifling bridge for over 10 minutes as the cleaning of the aircraft had not finished. Once boarded, we were – unlike the other Club Europe passengers – not offered a glass of water but, worst of all (and unforgivable) found food debris and other dirt in between our seats (so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished). When I opened my meal tray, it clearly had not been cleaned as there were crumbs and stains on it. We took photographs and also pointed our findings out to the very pleasant stewardess, who seemed utterly appalled when she looked. The meal was pleasant but we were not offered coffee or tea afterwards. And whilst I do not object to being served wine from a large bottle, it means one gets only a (smallish) glassful so has to ask for a refill, something not everybody likes to do. This practice of pouring from a large bottle is clearly a cost-cutting exercise. On previous occasions we had been disappointed to find that no lounge facilities for Club Europe passengers are available in airports like Corfu, Rhodes, Heraklion, even Seville (contrary to BA’s website at the time – we were told at all these airports ‘ BA no longer pays for its passengers to have access’) so, this time, my wife enquired well in advance whether we would have lounge access in Naples. She was told No; but at least, we knew beforehand – or so we thought, but when we got the holding area prior to the gate opening, we were joined by some rather merry Club Europe passengers who told us that there was a lounge (though not exclusively for BA use) that they had been able to access and enjoy! Why could the check-in staff not have told us? The waiting area did not have sufficient seats but we were lucky and found some. However, when a young lady arrived to deal with checking boarding cards, passengers who were sitting beyond where she stood, were forced to get up and move all the way back to the other side. Club Europe passengers were amongst the first to be called, so that did not look too bad. Know what? We showed our boarding pass, then had to stand (no seats available) in a very cramped area for 14 minutes before the gate was opened. In other words, we had the doubtful privilege of having to stand for longer than other passengers.",5,2017-07-10, United Kingdom ,False,review naples gatwick used admire love ba longer admire dislike soon likely hate think one entitled pleasant expectation paying inconsiderable supplement flying club europe wife noticed constant deterioration last two year complained received avios compensation time cup overfloweth unfortunately blessing allocated aisle seat separate row even though wife preference state like window seat plenty seat adjacent available permitted make online change manage get seat next ba keep trip started well enough new ba south terminal lounge spacious good selection drink food magazine time came boarding amongst others club europe passenger invited board first check made resulted almighty scrum anybody pushed forward immediately exacerbated stand cooped stifling bridge minute cleaning aircraft finished boarded unlike club europe passenger offered glass water worst unforgivable found food debris dirt seat much wait cleaning finished opened meal tray clearly cleaned crumb stain took photograph also pointed finding pleasant stewardess seemed utterly appalled looked meal pleasant offered coffee tea afterwards whilst object served wine large bottle mean one get smallish glassful ask refill something everybody like practice pouring large bottle clearly cost cutting exercise previous occasion disappointed find lounge facility club europe passenger available airport like corfu rhodes heraklion even seville contrary ba website time told airport ba longer pay passenger access time wife enquired well advance whether would lounge access naples told least knew beforehand thought got holding area prior gate opening joined rather merry club europe passenger told u lounge though exclusively ba use able access enjoy could check staff told u waiting area sufficient seat lucky found however young lady arrived deal checking boarding card passenger sitting beyond stood forced get move way back side club europe passenger amongst first called look bad know showed boarding pas stand seat available cramped area minute gate opened word doubtful privilege stand longer passenger

For a flight of 11.5 hours to Mauritius, I was shocked by the quality of the economy class seats and that BA seriously consider them good enough for a long haul flight of this length. Possibly the least comfortable airline seat I've ever had, with every lump and bump imaginable, and the infuriating headrest which doesn't stay up, slipping down and banging you in the neck every 15 minutes. The seat back offered no protection from the person behind putting things in their seat pocket. Legroom also very poor (albeit I am above average height) but my knees were pressed against the seat in front even before they reclined into me. The food was also poor. No snacks offered, and the meals were slop. I have flown Air NZ, Virgin, Emirates and BA in the last two years and BA was the poorest in terms of food and comfort.

I am a silver BA card holder and reserved two flights (myself and my wife) from Boston to London Heathrow (in premium economy) and Heathrow to Barcelona in Economy class. I paid for seat reservations for my wife on both legs as she has a bronze card and cannot reserve without paying. On check in at Boston we were given different seats for the Heathrow to Barcelona sector than I had reserved (in the exit row), due to a change of aircraft configuration. Although the booking was made months before no advance notice was given of the change. In early June I applied for a refund of the seat reservation cost and  was given a case number. To date there has been no communication or refund from BA in spite of my sending a second email asking for information. Overall the service onboard and attention to customers has declined significantly over the past year due to cost cutting measures. We will not be flying transatlantic with BA in the future after 7 years of several crossings each year. In an article about British Airways in the Financial Times on 2nd June it said that their customers are less and less happy, but due to increased earning from cost cutting the shareholders are very happy.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Hong Kong in premium economy. I have been flying BA on my many trips over the last six years, and I have seen such a shocking decline in their services that I feel compelled to write this review. Of my six flights this year, three were seriously delayed. One was from Oslo to London on 9th June, when the captain decided to wait  for some Business Class passengers who hadn't made their way out of the lounge in time for take-off. My worst experience, however, was going to Hong Kong on 30th May, when there was a technical fault with the plane. The captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time, who then sat on the plane for almost three hours, without being offered any water or other refreshments, and with little information and apologies, before an 11-hour flight. I was in Premium Economy, but the extra amount I paid did not offer any additional comfort. I switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets, which meant that I got no rest during the night. How can Premium Economy seats be next to the toilet? The in-flight service was poor, as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night. I am still wondering why anybody would pay for Premium Economy, as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in Economy (but don't recline as they would in Economy), the food is the same, which means rather bad, and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight. Predictably, the plane landed in Hong Kong just in time (below three hours' delay) for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight. I had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th June, but then I found out that BA had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for Premium Economy passengers. Although this time the flight was on time, this gave me such a bad feeling about BA, their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness.

"✅ Verified Review |  Belfast to Munich via Heathrow. Today (4th July) I found I needed to change a travel date from 7th July to 6th July.  I attempted to do this on BA's ""Manage My Booking"" for about 2 hours and, although I selected 4 different flight times, each time I thought my booking change was completed (at an extra cost of £156-199 + seat costs), I was told that my changed flights were fully booked, even though my booking included purchase of seats shown as available (quite a few). So. I contacted BA's Customer Services by phone and waited for about 20 minutes for an agent who, after saying hello and providing his name, promptly lost me. So, another 20 minutes later, I spoke to another (very caring and helpful) BA agent and she told me the only available flight changes would cost me almost +£500 onto my £218 ticket! I could have booked a new return ticket for a lot less! I am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by BA when all the work is by me and on-line and BA can re-sell my Friday flight; the time I spent going around in circles, online, to end up with nothing and having to phone Customer Services; and  the time it takes to get though to Customer Services who, clearly, are insufficiently staffed, over-worked and with limited capacity to really help.

All was going well (which in Accra means an orderly boarding), got to the end of the runway when the pilot announced that we would be returning to the stand as there was a discrepancy on the cargo load (I assume more loaded than was on the manifest). The takeoff was terminated seconds before the engines started their job. This then took an hour to sort out (with cargo being removed) - no drinks offered (this was business class I reminded myself). Once off the flight was the standard British Airways club world product. Nothing special or memorable, but at least was not full so the reaching over the dividing screen to serve did not have to happen.

As a regular on this route I can verify these unacceptable delays. Indeed my flight the delay was, as usual, over an hour. The Club World product is now very tired and worn - no updates to it despite the constant updates by other carriers. The BA crew were fine, but not given good enough product tools to outshine other airlines. Usual chaotic boarding process for this flight - the airlines knows it will have issues with hand luggage, but always board the plane with only thirty minutes to departure. It will never work on this routing. When will BA learn? The seating in the usual BA format for business class is just not keeping up with other airlines - including One World members like Qatar, American or Royal Jordanian. The constant having to lower the divider between seats to serve is both rude and poor service. The comfort is now more akin to Ethiopian Airlines on their older aircraft rather than that expected of BA.

"✅ Verified Review |  Chennai to London. What a mistake, I selected this route for a two reasons, I wanted to try the new British Airways 787 in Club class and the timing. But I have nothing good to say about the whole thing. The lounge at Chennai was poor but at least it was near the gate. Once aboard the plane we discovered that instead of what I think should be standard in Business class there is no direct aisle access for the Window seats and if you're in the Aisle seat you'll have people climbing over your legs to access the aisle and the hostess leaning over you to serve the person in the window seat, the layout is quite crazy. The seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how BA have crammed them all in that's the issue. I had the window seat and initially I found it OK, but as it was a very long all daytime flight I had to dim the window and that's the point you can only dim them down, there is no blind, the sun still shines through, OK I accept it's like looking through very dark Sun glasses but it's not possible to cut out the light as you get with blinds. I understand several other airlines are retro fitting blinds on the 787 but this is a major error by Boeing. It was my second flight on a 787, both were 11 hour plus flights, the earlier one I made was at night so no issue with the window blinds. I've not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of the aircraft I find myself just as tired after a flight as I would be on any other aircraft. I'm a long term supporter of BA and I'm so upset that BA are going backwards, focusing on profits and ripping off the customer.

Brand new lounge was really comfortable and with a great selection of food, drink and magazines, access to the lounge not very convenient but given the design of the terminal I realize that nothing can be done about that. The gate number was only announced 20 minutes prior to the gate closing and it was 20 minutes away at at fast pace, especially as there was a queue to exit the lounge by the two elevators. On board our Club Europe seats that we had paid extra to choose, something that no other airline that I know of does with a full Business Class fare, was behind the curtain. Overhead bins were full so ourselves and another 2 Club Europe passengers had to put their bags further back in the economy cabin without assistance. An engineer was called to try to move the divider and curtain back but it was stuck and remained between rows 2 and 3 with our seats being in row 3. My special meal was not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin was very obliging and a crew meal was provided for the short flight. Leg room was atrocious for Business Class and seats are the same as economy. Because the curtain could not be drawn, the Business Class toilet was used by Economy Class passengers and at times Business passengers had to queue behind them. Given the high expectations following the experience on the ground the plane was not up to standard however the service provided despite these lapses was great. Had to wait for about 20 minutes for bags despite being the only aircraft at Genoa Airport.

Flew British Airways from Beijing to London Heathrow. The cabin crew did their best, but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers. Cut backs are evident everywhere, from the small and very cheap hot towels (offered only once during the ten hours flight) and the nuts (presented in a packet, other than with other airlines on china and warm - this might seem a small niggle, but it is indication of BA saves costs - by annoying their premium cabin customer). The amenity kits, presented in a shoe bag, is a joke really. To be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other One World members (Royal Jordanian and Qatar for example). Flight left and arrived on time - but the airline should be more than that. The offering within the flight needs to be competitive and regain some ground. Was presented, at the second meal serice, with frozen pawns on bread (returned and a de-frosted plate came by return). Unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea - but no effect as yet. Part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight, I covered it up with a spare blanket. Despite there being enough toilets for Club World passengers there was often a line of people waiting from World Traveller Plus - snaking past seat in rows 15 and 16. No control of passengers from World Traveller Plus coming in to the Club World cabin. Toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew - twice they were in a bit of state so I ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself. Lovely.

"✅ Verified Review |  Leeds to Durban via London / Johannesburg. Check in at Leeds was efficient. Security was slow, so fast track was appreciated. Boarding was relatively quick and flight departed early. Seating was reasonably comfortable but cramped, and service is basically non existent unless one is prepared to pay for food. Transfer at Heathrow was a breeze, surprisingly with no further security check. Boarding commenced in good time and was quick and smooth onto the upper deck, with a pleasant greeting from the crew. The premium economy cabin is very pleasant with good seat width and legroom. The seats are comfortable, but both our seats were faulty. Mine would not stay upright and my wife's would not recline. Unfortunately we did not realise the extent of the problem immediately and only reported it next morning. We were moved to business class - we should have reported it immediately! Sparkling wine and fruit juice were offered before take off, unfortunately the quality has been hit by cost savings. Bar service followed quickly after take off, but again the quality of wines was average and not up to the standard offered by other airline in premium economy. We both ordered beef fillet for dinner - alternative was chicken - which was good and served on proper crockery with decent cutlery. Breakfast next morning was economy class fare with plastic cutlery, which along with the cheap and nasty amenity kit lets down the standard and one questions whether the cost saving is really worth the negative impression created. The A380 is very quiet and most passengers seemed to sleep. There were several drink runs during the night, and the cabin crew were quite active. Arrival was on time and everything went smoothly.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Paris Orly. I have been a gold member of BA over 25 years making approx 100 flights per year We have been through ash clouds, strikes, IT breakdowns and weather and of late the spiral of poor response has picked up pace. I didnt think it could get worse but it did. Arrived at the airport and my app said on time, screens said on time but my independent tracking app said 3 hours delay. In the first class lounge I was told short delay. Knowing how inaccurate BA can be I asked to speak to special services. One hour later I asked again. I got an arrogant manager who lectured me that she was only two on duty, take it up with Alex Cruz and there were more important flyers like royalty and celebrity. Unimportant is how I felt after 25 years of Gold guest list. She then told me the flight was cancelled and said I would have to either accept the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement .Staff didnt know how to get people out of the airport and despte flights on time for Charles De Gaulle no alternative was offered. I had to concede and cancelled critical business discussion and then beg BA for a refund which they tried to sidestep. The moral of this story is when your gut tells you trust has gone believe it and at BA it is systemic lack of honesty and transparency and it all points to the CEO. The other interesting fact is I did look at choices before booking including Easy jet <100 pounds Air France 500 pounds and foolishly I felt loyalty meant something. Not at this airlin . The salt in the wound is that Easyjet and AF got to their destination on time and no doubt executives on those flights are enjoying a good business day in France. It is incredible that one airline who carry's the British flag is such a disgrace.

"✅ Verified Review |  British Airways charges a big premium for Premium Economy. I sat on the top floor of the A380 after being upgraded from World Traveller at the gate, and enjoyed an aisle seat flying from Singapore to London Heathrow. There were two dinner options, chicken tikka or beef fillet, but as I dozed off I missed out. So no food until 1 hour before landing (11 hours later) unless I wanted to pay for chocolates with a credit card. I kindly asked for some water, got some orange juice too - didn't want to push it even though I saw a bottle of champagne open in the galley - not worth the risk of a bad reaction. I cannot recommend this cabin based on the high prices they charge.

"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to London. I have started to take British Airways as it's a corporate requirement. The Business Class (Club World) is more like Premium Economy. The seats are small and uncomfortable especially with the layout for the passenger sitting next to the window - you are basically trapped inside and you'd have to disturb the other passenger to get out. Furthermore, the ""bed"" does not extend fully so it uses creatively a makeshift ""fold down stool"" - if you apply too much pressure on that stool, it unlocks itself and seem to break off from the latch - it's just flimsy! The food is very low quality and tatstes bland - I have already tried the regular meal and special meals - don't bother. The service is poor with a crew that is  not bothered to provide for the comfort of business class passengers. Overall, I am very disappointed.

"✅ Verified Review |  This was my first flight from Toronto to London crewed by ""Mixed Fleet"". Easy check-in at Toronto Pearson (The BA ground staff are always great in Toronto) with fast track meant I was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport. The lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited (average) wine list. Still too few bathrooms, the seats are tatty, and when busy is not a relaxing place to be. Easy boarding and the first of a few improvements - prosecco now served to London. (used to be only ex London). Fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer. An OK Chicken curry was served but I still don't see it as Biz class food. A choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each. That is where the improvements ended. The morning offering of a cereal bar and T&Cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little BA care about the entire journey customer experience. The crew on this flight were great. Young, junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional. A request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi, but appeared (in glass) without asking as soon as the crew were released - classy and well remembered! The return flight was less good. Drinks served promptly after take off and my pre-booked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray. (Crew member's first flight since qualifying) It took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a WTP tray. The underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and T&C. Customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back (really) as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers. This cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours I need something more substantial than chocolate. Service reduced - yes, price reduced - no! The 777's in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of WTP, the IFE screens are tiny. Mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort. However, the male crew were more aloof, lacked attention to detail and officious. What these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of Long Haul crew - I hope they relax into the role soon! At least the cuts have stopped (not much left to cut I admit) and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show BA have listened. However, the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast US / Canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey.

On both flights, there was no water offered during the night, which is really a shame considered the price difference between economy and premium.

Eventually we all returned to the terminal as there was a problem on the plane (apparently a problem with the curtain structure that divides business from economy). There was no communication from the ground staff, which although not BA staff reflects badly on the airline. Once we were finally on-board the flight was trouble free. Good service.

Actually it replaced what was BA economy class. A cynical ploy by the BA board to extract more money out of its loyal customers?

Check-in and lounge experience were great, but once I got onboard it became obvious how clapped out some of the 767 aircraft are. There were seats with missing backs and 'Do Not Occupy' covers in front and beside them, random bits of electrical wiring hanging down from rails in the overhead, and grimy, yellowed staining around most of the cabin interior. You have to worry about what's going on the important bits, like the engines, if the same standard is applied outside the aircraft as in the cabin. The crew spent as much time as they could in the galley, and interacted with passengers as little as possible. The breakfast service was a salt-infused hot cooked offering, and just one run of drinks. Anything else you wanted you had to use the call button. The one and only reason I booked this cabin was that it was actually just a few pounds more expensive on the overall ticket routing I'd bought.",7,2017-06-13, United Kingdom ,False,review london heathrow madrid absolute third world experience got plane check lounge experience great got onboard became obvious clapped aircraft seat missing back occupy cover front beside random bit electrical wiring hanging rail overhead grimy yellowed staining around cabin interior worry going important bit like engine standard applied outside aircraft cabin crew spent much time could galley interacted passenger little possible breakfast service salt infused hot cooked offering one run drink anything else wanted use call button one reason booked cabin actually pound expensive overall ticket routing bought

A pretty empty cabin, filthy isn't the word, awful in flight entertainment (Rockwell) that hasn't changed in 10 years easily. Food choice is no longer a choice, its a meat dish or veg. alcoholic beverages are loaded at origin (LGW) for both legs, so they have now halved what they usually stocked previously. 3 hours into flight there was no spirits left - bearing in mind only one drink had been served prior to the meal service 1.5 hours in to the flight. BA state in their motto ""to fly, to serve"". Yes they certainly are flying, but most certainly not serving. The cabin crew are ashamed and embarrassed at the cuts which is evident in their conversations at the back of the aircraft, and to anyone who speaks to them they are disgusted with what the bosses have done. They have cheapened the brand of the national carrier, but haven't cheapened their prices. easyjet and Ryanair offer superior, and on long haul its got to the point I will now fly Virgin and others, again offer more for your money in all aspects of the flight.

In Business the seats are identical to economy so what are we actually paying for? There is no place to power devices and forget WiFi or overhead screens.

"✅ Verified Review |  I am a frequent flyer with British Airways, having held Silver membership for years. On this instance, I flew BA's short-haul business class. While you're essentially in the same cabin as everyone else, you should get a meal onboard (something I had counted on) and the seat next to you should be left empty. I fly this route around once every other week, but have been BA to long-haul destinations (Hong Kong, Beijing, NYC, D.C. and San Francisco) several times a year, my experience on this flight tallies with the other flights I have taken this year on the same and other routes. The aircraft came in late, which is a common occurrence with BA these days. Except for me, nobody in Business Class had an empty seat next to them. We were then informed by the overworked and tired flight attendant that no food had been delivered, although we 'might be' able to obtain food vouchers once we get to LCY. In short, the product was exactly the same as Economy class but at an added premium of at least the price of your regular economy ticket. This was complemented by slow and unfriendly check-in staff, an old aircraft, and a good hour I had spent on the phone with unaccountable and disinterested BA customer service to work out if the online upgrade had gone through. On the whole, a number of instances that simply add up make me feel that BA is very much going in the wrong direction. They might be cheap, but can't and shouldn't compete with low-cost carriers or indeed Asian airlines that have lower overhead costs.

"✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I were very disappointed with our British Airways flights from Sydney to London return, flying Premium economy. The food quality, cutlery and service was of a much lower standard than other airlines such as Air New Zealand and Qantas that we have used. There are no toilets allocated for the cabin, and are located at the middle of the economy cabin, quite a long walk and at times a very long line of other passengers waiting to use them. The seats are a bit more comfortable and spacious than economy class, the entertainment viewing screen is ok as are the films music and earphones. BA don't offer priority check in at airports as do other airlines. We would not fly with BA premium economy again, it is not worth paying the much more expensive fare than the standard economy fare.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Vancouver. I am very disappointed by BA's gradual decline. Today I flew in the upper deck of the A380. BA's business class seats, once the best in the industry, are almost the worst. The pods are 8 abreast in the upper deck and very narrow. This is an unpleasant aircraft, with 3 toilets to share between 64 passengers. In business Class I think that's a poor ratio. The flight attendants were initially reasonably friendly (though I noticed no acknowledgement for being a Gold Card holder), but their interest waned as the flight progressed. It took 2 hours to get a drink and almost 4 hours from take off before the main course was served. The beef was cold as were the vegetables. It was actually inedible. I suspect it had just been left out. After dinner we were half way through our 8 hour flight and I was never offered another drink. I gave my suit to be hung up and had to beg to reclaim it at the end of the flight. British Airways has gone from being one of the best to one of the worst airlines I have flown recently. This is a great shame. The cabin is bad, the food is awful, the flight attendants unpleasant and IFE OK.

The catering was really poor and seemed to have been affected by cost cutting: lunch was a small portion of very tough beef, accompanied by a tiny salad which was still frozen; there was then nothing for nine hours (no snacks available anymore) until a second hot meal, of a small chicken curry, was served shortly before landing. A choice of drinks was offered only once, shortly after takeoff; during the entire remainder of the flight the crew came around again twice with water and juice, but nothing else was offered; the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water and nothing else (I asked for more water but the crew said they didn't have any).

This came with a inedible salad concoction and a bread roll. The only other food offered was two tiny sandwich triangles for 'afternoon tea' with a miniscule scone.

We used the lounges as we have a silver card, and they were busy, but well staffed, and the food was good. On the aircraft we took our own home made sandwiches since we really didn't fancy the Marks and Spencer prices. I bought a bottle of water close to our gate, and thought that was expensive enough, but the BA on board water was £1.80 per bottle. I did notice that the flight attendants were very good at giving out small glasses of free water. Like many, I can't get used to this budget airways approach, it's clearly embarrassing the staff who are very good. On our return, we had big delays due to the storms in southern England, and air traffic restrictions. Then, we had Brussels air traffic delay due to their system failure. At all times, the first officer kept us well informed and we got back to London and were parked on a good jetty so that we could rush to catch up.

First, I couldn't change it online as the 'manage your flight' option didn't work (they told me it happens some times), and I tried it a lot of times before contacting them, so I had to pay +25$ for changing it via phone (they took the money even though it wasn't my fault). I made more than 50 calls from November to a day before traveling to reissuing my e-ticket. After a long wait to get connected, they took my credit card data and said they will proceed to reissuing the e-ticket and sent it to my e-mail, for nearly 6 months it never come until 1 day before the flight. Every time I called they said they didn't have my cvv which I re-confirmed every time. When asked when will I get the ticket, they said: after 10 days, which only came on 27th of March and I was to travel on 28th. Once they nearly set me to fly to Charlotte, NC, while confirming my data and cvv during one of the 50 calls I made. Besides this, the food was ridiculous, but never mind that, the anxiety, time consumed and the distress they caused can't be either bought or excused.

"✅ Verified Review |  Chicago to London Heathrow on British Airways much vaunted Sleeper Service in Business Class. Be advised, this service is a joke. Never mind the terrible, dated, seats facing one another, but the BA Sleeper Service mandates you eat in their awful Biz Class lounge at ORD, and then suffer no dinner service on the plane. This is a monumental con. Also, imagine your worst school meal in a school cafeteria, and that is what you get in the BA lounge at ORD. The food was some kind of dreadful steamed slop that you literally would not feed your dog. I used to imagine that long haul business and first class passengers were valued by trans-Atlantic airlines. The British Airways business class product is the worst by far.

"✅ Verified Review |  I am shocked about how the First Class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrier. On our flight to Tokyo Narita from London Heathrow we were advised by the Cabin Crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were 'limited'. To cut a long story short, this meant that my partner, who was the last to be served, was told what was available rather than asked what he would like. This is in spite of there being only 5 passengers in the 8 seat cabin. For breakfast prior to landing, we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first served. The presentation of the food that was available was poor & certainly not worthy of the fine dining description BA uses for its First Class catering. We spoke to the Cabin Services Manager who was extremely apologetic & confirmed that there has been cost cutting - apparently at the behest of the new CEO who comes from low cost sister airline Vueling, with a resultant increase in unhappiness & complaints from passengers. The famous First Class Tasting Menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone & other cost cutting around on board service is very evident - even the rose in the First Class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that BA has become. I fly regularly long haul with KLM & their new Business Class offering is now far superior to BA's First. How can our national airline, with whom we should be proud to fly, compete with other superior European & Gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers? The Cabin Services Manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 May. Almost a month later, although immediately acknowledged, BA have not responded, probably due to more administrative cost cutting. I should add that the ground service at Heathrow T5 & the Concorde Room were very good but as regards on board service, BA offends their premium passengers like this at their peril.",6,2017-06-02, United Kingdom ,False,review shocked first class board service deteriorated evident cost cutting supposed national flag carrier flight tokyo narita london heathrow advised cabin crew soon take catering supply loaded limited cut long story short meant partner last served told available rather asked would like spite passenger seat cabin breakfast prior landing informed two cooked breakfast available would first come first served presentation food available poor certainly worthy fine dining description ba us first class catering spoke cabin service manager extremely apologetic confirmed cost cutting apparently behest new ceo come low cost sister airline vueling resultant increase unhappiness complaint passenger famous first class tasting menu enjoyed previous flight gone cost cutting around board service evident even rose first class toilet dead really epitomises lacklustre airline ba become fly regularly long haul klm new business class offering far superior ba first national airline proud fly compete superior european gulf carrier emphasis seems never ending cost cutting affect even premium passenger cabin service manager entered formal complaint behalf board may almost month later although immediately acknowledged ba responded probably due administrative cost cutting add ground service heathrow concorde room good regard board service ba offends premium passenger like peril
"✅ Verified Review |  Absolute Cheapskates. Business class flight in 'Club Europe' from Luxembourg to London Heathrow is beyond a joke, and clearly on a shoe-string budget. No pre-meal drink offered. Limited selection of drinks, with wine served in plastic screw-top mini bottles warm with no nuts/nibbles. Meal selection consisted of a chicken salad/prawn (which looked reasonably nice however I'm allergic to seafood) or a toasted cheese roll.

"✅ Verified Review |  Choose a budget airline, the magic of our national carrier has gone. We have always chosen British Airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now it's on par or lower than other low cost carriers. Firstly we didn't get any priority boarding with our two young children. EasyJet provides this. Secondly, we reserved seats as travelling with our two children, they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows. On boarding we were told the plane has changed, therefore we now had assigned seats. Thirdly, after paying over £10 for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife I needed the loo, first class was out of bounds. So the only option the rear of the plane, however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past (I guess those drinks they were selling had the BA executive team seeing many ££££ so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority). After a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past, but once out they had gone back to the middle of the plane. A crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea. Our flight from Heathrow to Bergen was only an hour and 40, but I spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member. The return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my 80 year old grandmother and technology. The safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off, the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof, asked the crew - ""Cabin crew, seats for landing"". The captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight, even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with 'that landing'. All minor points, but they were the points we enjoyed with BA, points that made us choose them, small points that made the difference. The pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them, the cabin crew that always went over and beyond. The free drinks that made us feel special to ask and get, I'd rather pay a premium for all that or choose a budget airline. Gutted our British Airways national carrier has become a budget airline. Perhaps cost savings are needed, but for now, although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture, they need to cost save some more to make up our future tickets and my recommendations are now also dead.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Seoul return. I booked my return flights back in January when BA were having their annual sale for around £1700. Thought this was a bargain as they are usually up around £3000. London to Seoul flight was very pleasant. Didn't get to use the business class lounge in Heathrow as my connection from Manchester was delayed by 40 minutes. Cabin crew on the actual flight were excellent and very attentive. Food and drink was what you would expect of most business class airlines with a decent amount of high-quality menu choices. The seat layout of 2-3-2 with seats facing in the opposite direction to each other and a divider between them felt a little bit cramped. The seats were very comfortable and went flat which is better than some, however there is a fold-down seat/step in front of you that you have to use to able to stretch out fully. I'm 6'0 and found I was at my limit of being able to stretch out fully so anyone taller than that would probably be a bit uncomfortable. Inflight entertainment had a decent range of tv and films to choose from including some of the more recent releases. Toilets were also smaller and more cramped than on other airlines that I've flown business class with before. The only let down was that the cabin itself was hotter than the sun and I found it difficult to sleep because of this. Seoul to London was what really let BA down for me and left a sour note on what was an amazing 3 months in Korea. In the days leading up to the flight, BA's ""massive IT Failure"" and the lack of information and help surrounding it meant I was having to frantically check if my flight would be leaving at all, with the flights on the 27th and 28th being cancelled completely. Luckily they got it sorted in the early hours of the morning on the day of the flight. The flight and cabin crew arrived late for the flight and so take-off was delayed by 30 minutes. I had a connecting flight to catch to Manchester so it was imperative that everything went smoothly as I had just over an hour after landing to make it. The flight was lovely with the cabin crew doing an amazing job. The pilots managed to make up for lost time and so we ended up landing 5 minutes earlier than scheduled. However, due to the backlog of delayed and cancelled flights from the past couple of days, there was another flight in the space where mine was supposed to park. This meant a delay of 20 minutes while we waited on the tarmac for the space to become free. This was time I could not afford to lose. We eventually disembarked at 14:45 which meant I had to sprint through the airport to passport control and to the baggage reclaim. Really wish I hadn't as it still took 20 minutes for the bags to come off the plane. By the time I had done all this and gone through arrivals it was 15:15 and the gate was closing in 10 mins. Talked to BA customer services and got rebooked on another flight back to the IOM (where I live) from London City but they could only book me on the 14:50pm flight the next day. Wasn't at all happy with the experience overall because of this and for what you would normally pay (over £3,000 when not on sale) it really wasn't worth the hassle for me personally.",1,2017-05-30, United Kingdom ,False,review london heathrow seoul return booked return flight back january ba annual sale around thought bargain usually around london seoul flight pleasant get use business class lounge heathrow connection manchester delayed minute cabin crew actual flight excellent attentive food drink would expect business class airline decent amount high quality menu choice seat layout seat facing opposite direction divider felt little bit cramped seat comfortable went flat better however fold seat step front use able stretch fully found limit able stretch fully anyone taller would probably bit uncomfortable inflight entertainment decent range tv film choose including recent release toilet also smaller cramped airline flown business class let cabin hotter sun found difficult sleep seoul london really let ba left sour note amazing month korea day leading flight ba massive failure lack information help surrounding meant frantically check flight would leaving flight th th cancelled completely luckily got sorted early hour morning day flight flight cabin crew arrived late flight take delayed minute connecting flight catch manchester imperative everything went smoothly hour landing make flight lovely cabin crew amazing job pilot managed make lost time ended landing minute earlier scheduled however due backlog delayed cancelled flight past couple day another flight space mine supposed park meant delay minute waited tarmac space become free time could afford lose eventually disembarked meant sprint airport passport control baggage reclaim really wish still took minute bag come plane time done gone arrival gate closing min talked ba customer service got rebooked another flight back iom live london city could book pm flight next day happy experience overall would normally pay sale really worth hassle personally

"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Lima return in Business Class. No choice of seats until 24hr before the flight unless you paid extra (I understand their desire to reward frequent flyers but paying £50+pp per flight if you aren't is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz). By the time we were able to check in, there was only one option left if we wanted to sit together. New BA lounge at LGW smart but packed out at the start of Easter holidays. Limited food offering at breakfast - no hot food at all, unless you count lukewarm pastries. FA service on flights in both directions was good, though outbound the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services, despite it being a day flight. Food and drink were fine but nothing special - some choices not available by the time they got to us. Seating layout of 2-4-2 in business class is very cramped, especially if the flight is full - the highest-density seating I've ever experienced in business - and there was no surface to put anything on unless you had your tray table open. Small drawer at your feet. Recommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if you're travelling solo - no legs to climb over! Lie-flat seat was comfortable though for a short person. IFE was poor compared to competitors - hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movies available. On the way home we didn't mind a long layover at LIM as we thought we could use the lounge. No such luck - we couldn't be checked in all the way through from LPB so had to pick up luggage, go through immigration again and wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before BA staff appeared to check in the flight home. Only seat choice available again were two together on the aisle side of a middle pair. Very fortunate not to have anyone in the other middle seat next to me, otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a total stranger! Haven't travelled long-haul with BA for several years and can only describe it as a functional, value service, even in Business, though it's not cheap. I'd only use BA again if they were the most convenient by a long way (as happened here for a direct flight from London), or for a great price on short-haul. There's really no comparison to Emirates' long-haul offering in Business.

On top of that there were just 2 toilets for 120 people while business class customers enjoyed 2 toilets between 20 of them. Of course we also had to queue behind the serving trolley to get to the toilet so you can imagine how long that took!

"✅ Verified Review |  Antigua to Gatwick. Check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient (better than Gatwick) and although we had a slight delay at immigration, we were soon airside. The new lounge was really comfortable and although we didn't use it (it was dark when we were there) they have an excellent sky terrace with loungers and shaded sofa's etc. The bar was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food. Boarding was on time. On board it was soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better days with my wife's TV nearly falling off its mounting. Fortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precarious. Push back and departure was exactly on time. Within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange. Unlike the flight out, where there was a more relaxed atmosphere, the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisles. The food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless. I can only assume that the object of their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possible. To be quite honest I felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and I almost expected them to say 'I want you to go to sleep now and I don't want to here a sound out any of you until the morning'! Now I know that the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc, but at the end of the day (or night) they are working and are getting paid to do so. In my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers, it would improve the flight considerably. Breakfast was OK although I seemed to be the only person trying the bacon rolls and after one mouthful I understood why. In a blind tasting I probably would have guessed I was eating rubber bands. We arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim, our cases were waiting for us.

"✅ Verified Review |  I was pleasantly surprised with British Airways on both outbound and inbound flights from Orlando to Gatwick after reading the reviews. I would go as far as to say I would choose them over Virgin now unless there was a dramatic price difference. The crew both ways were friendly and really helpful, I have found Virgin crew to be a bit up themselves thinking they are a cut above the rest. Contrary to how Virgin crew are on an overnight flight (serve food, dim lights and keep out the way until hour before landing) BA crew still regularly came round making sure everyone was ok and if anyone wanted anything. We had nearly 3 hour delay leaving Orlando on G-VIIU, firstly due to inbound being a bit late due to an alligator closing the runway and finally a medical issue on board whilst positioned on runway to go. We returned to gate for paramedics, top up of fuel etc and departed at 20.20 versus 17.35. Throughout the crew were fantastic bringing drinks round and keeping us all informed. Whilst the interior of the leisure fleet of 777 is a bit on the tired side it was still comfortable I can recommend 24D as there is no PAX seat behind just a crew seat so no issues with being kneed in the back.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Santiago de Chile. Surprisingly pleasing flight onboard Boeing 787, decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window seat and discovered the B787 is - or looks - far lighter and wider than any B777 I've been travelling on (could be larger windows or the fuselage shape which makes the ""cocoon"" look less cramped). Even the seat looks wider, while the IFE screen is wider with a higher resolution. The odd ""ying-yang"" layout is slightly better on Boeing 787 as the central rows do not have the honeymoon seats, therefore you won't share such a narrow space with a stranger in case you end up there. So first impression better than usual; unfortunately the soft product remains way below par (I pre-ordered the main dish of the meal which this time was actually available, but the beef was overcooked and chewy), I will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit is simply ridiculous - sort of a blue shoe bag, too small to fit shoes though. The crew very friendly but slightly less attentive than usual. Overall the experience was better than usual - mainly thanks to a newer, quieter aircraft - but BA is not improving where they should, in those details that make business class something worth EUR3,000 spent.

"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Antigua. This was our first time in quite a while travelling from the South Terminal and the first impression was that the BA check in area was a little cramped. It was quite busy at the CW check in with about five couples in front of us but as there were four desks open, we were through in about five minutes. The fast track security was quiet and we were soon in the new lounge. This is a huge improvement from its predecessor in the north terminal with nice views, comfortable seats and reasonable food (I had a small bacon roll and a very strange omelette roll?). The departure gate was quite cramped with not enough seating for all of the passengers but as the flight was on time, it didn't really matter. We had made the decision some time ago not to pay an additional cost to select our seats prior to the 24 hour check in as this would have cost up to £340 for my wife and I, depending where you wanted to sit. However, we were pleasantly surprised with the seats we were allocated as we would probably have chosen these anyway. After boarding we were offered a glass of sparkling wine, which for a change was pleasantly chilled. The staff were generally friendly, especially a young guy who said it was his first long haul trip. Once airborne we were offered two drinks with nuts before lunch and then more drinks with lunch. We had pre ordered our food so we knew what we were getting although the quality was just OK (I ordered a chicken curry which was rather bland). The interior of the plane was rather showing its age with stains on the carpet with an overall drab ambience. Also, the IFE seems to be getting worse and unusually my wife found it difficult to watch a film due to the poor resolution.

"✅ Verified Review |  BA12 onboard British Airways A380 for the gruelling 13 hours from Singapore to London Heathrow is pretty hellish for economy passengers. I'd like to be biased to BA - I'm silver member and British and it's my national carrier but come on let's get to the chase. This route is now also served by Garuda and Singapore and I can say BA are at the bottom of the list for the economy service. Seats are really uncomfortable and near impossible to find an angle to get some rest, the pillows are wafer thin - like sitting on a a bunch of tissues bundled together. Food is lousy and they have removed the silverware and dinner extras like crackers, chocolates and other things that you can snack on.

BA now offers all food and drinks for purchase but the service was so slow and by the time we'd almost reached our destination there was a bit of an argument with a passenger who'd ordered a hot sandwich, but because the payment machine wasn't working, they took the food back to the galley and left the passenger without.

It turned out to be quite a pleasant and enjoyable experience. Thanks to early online-check-in I managed to secure a bulkhead aisle-seat. I would have preferred a window-seat though. Boarding started on time and there was a very friendly purser welcoming the passengers. After I settled down I approached her with my request. She said that the flight was completely full but promised to do her best. After less than five minutes she returned to me and offered me a seat at the window but emphasized that my actual seat had much more legroom. So I stayed. The rest of the crew seemed to be cheerful and happy too. Special requests by other passengers were dealt with professionalism. I brought my own snack and water along which was a wise thing to do as the catering-service was slow.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Toronto. British Airways has been the airline our organisation has chosen for our staff for years when they fly the routes offered to our business destinations. Recently as the Director I have been getting complaints about service, cleanliness and comfort from several members of my staff, which I have listened to but have been too busy and really hadn't listened properly, exactly what BA seems to do based on my personal experience. This recent trip to Toronto summed everything up for me. Firstly, after paying around £1000 extra each for a Premium Economy seat for each of the three of us travelling, unlike competitors BA does not provide priority boarding, you line up with all the other economy passengers?. When on board you are met with smiling staff, some immaculately dressed, others who look as if they have had a bad night, so who manages quality and standards?. Premium economy offers a little more space than economy, however that is about it. Service levels in the cabin are minimum, food is unexceptional, and to be honest is a disgrace compared to the price, and towards the end of the flight you are offered a second drink and 'a biscuit' delivered with all the fanfare of a 'gold bar' being delivered, however the discontent and upset on my flight by passengers in Premium Economy was both palpable and vocal, and staff could not have cared less. Other companies such as Air Canada offer a superior experience for the same price. BA management need to get their act together otherwise many customers such as my organisation are just on the edge of abandoning them completely. Familiarity definitely breeds contempt, but BA really is taking the biscuit with this and some of its other products. The marketing image does not match the reality.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Newark. We had heard a lot about the BA First Class ""wing"" at LHR and after checking in we made our way through it - directly from the check in area. The security and screening area is prompt and you find yourself in the First of the BA 1st Class lounges. If you did not know about the more exclusive ""Concorde"" lounge you would probably plonk yourself down here - as the check in staff did not mention the better lounge. The first one was rammed - end to end and we negotiated our way around the bags and carry on luggage strewn all over the place. The Concorde lounge was half empty and we had breakfast in the dining area. It was okay. The lounge is long, long overdue for a refurbishment. The Boeing 777 was parked at the B terminal and we were shown to our seats by a friendly FA. Champagne was served and for once it was chilled. The cabin looked a little tired and I suspect the plane was one of the first to have New First. We had the new Liberty branded wash bags which was light years ahead of the tacky bags we had last December. No amuse bouche - and no flowers in the WCs. There were nine passengers in First - and with an average spend £3,000 - one way, the total revenue would have been circa £36,000. Well done BA, you saved £10 for two bunch of flowers in the loos and 9 x £5 for the amuse bouche - grand saving of the operating costs a massive £55. Lunch was chosen from the cheap tacky menus (Pizza Express is better quality) - and my eyes popped as I read the lead appetizer, and I quote: ""Loch Fyne Kinglas smoked salmon with Oscietra caviar, Burford egg, shallots, creme fraiche and chive cress."" Oh my goodness - Caviar. My excitement was short lived. I had caviar alright - but just five eggs. (Yes folks 5 eggs, not 5 grams) You had to laugh. The soup was horrible. The salad never arrived.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Pisa. I fly this route often and this flight was my first out of the South Terminal. Its not as ""user friendly"" as the North - and meanders around, up and down - all over the place. Could also do with a refurbishment. We approached the new BA lounge, which is easy to miss not being in the best place in the Terminal, with reservations as everything BA does nowadays is cheap and skimpy. Pleasant surprise - its pretty top notch. Good food and plenty of booze. Nice and airy with spacious seating. We wondered for a moment if we had wandered into the wrong lounge. All good so far. Then the flight was called and our new found love affair with BA quickly receded. The walk to the gate was miles, it took us 15 minutes - and needed a bit of a run as well. Arrived all nice and sweaty. Plane was busy and we had the front row (the best seats). Usual disappointment with the lousy seats - economy masquerading as business seats. Plane old and dirty. The WC was disgusting - dark and dingy and the ""bowl"" - well, I dare not even try and describe it here - save it looked like the previous person had not flushed it - leaving a permanent effect. Took off on time. My wife had the sandwiches - which she said was dry and tasteless. I settled for a couple of Gin and Tonics.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Phoenix. I have been flying with British Airways for years, although I haven't used them recently. I was surprised at the service or lack of service. Our national carrier has turned into the worst. The crew are nce and friendly, so no real complaints apart from on a 10.5 hour flight during the day, they were nowhere to be seen until about 1.5 hours before landing. The food was absolutely appalling. For dinner we were offered a choice between meat and vegetarian. I had chicken filet which was as hard as leather with some sort of indistinguishable brown gravy and totally tasteless.The chicken was served sweet potatoe mash and a pea purée, this was the only thing edible on the plate. A tiny beetroot salad. The obligatory hard as rock bread roll. For dessert, a small piece of chocolate brownie.Complimentary drinks were out of sight so most people didn't realise they could ask for wine etc. A small container of water was on the tray.This meal was served about 2 hours into the flight and then nothing again to eat until roughly before landing. At which time was served a folded slice of pizza served in a box, a packet of crisp and popcorn (all carbohydrates) and a small container of water. I tasted the pizza and it was tasteless and just like cardboard.So I left it and took the crisps and popcorn with me.Then tea/coffee was served.  I am not expecting a gourmet meal, but there was no thought given to the food provided on British Airways. There was no fruit, no salad, or proper vegetables. There were no soft drinks offered or any proper serving of even the basic water. The flight entertainment did not exist. A couple of new films, the rest were old or unheard of. The music/radio (audio) was the same with no new music or unheard of artists. My daughter, booked this expensive direct flight for me to my destination in the US.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Bangkok. We had already flown BA10 from Bangkok to London a month ago so were really hoping that we got better seats in the crazy business class seating on this route. Of course we had to pay extra to reserve the seats but wanted to make sure we were together so booked J and K seats. Check in at LHR was good, lounge at T5 was packed (Friday afternoon), and I was not happy that we had to be bussed to flight. No priority boarding and when bus arrived the whole herd boarded into business class door and we couldn't even get to our seats! On boarding, toilet in business class was out of order with a scribbled note stuck on the door (why wasn't it fixed prior to the flight?). For some reason throughout the flight people were coming into business class to use the toilet which angered me as staff did not stop them. Constant queues for toilet with one not in action and other cabin passengers using the business toilet! Not good enough. Food and wine were OK and crew were good. Flat bed was good.

"✅ Verified Review | Singapore to London Heathrow - after reading the negative reviews and the press about BA of late, I was not expecting much at all from this trip. Terminal 5 is a breeze and has to be one of the best things about flying with BA, we checked in and cleared security within 20 minutes. We secured seats on the upper deck of the A380, which seemed more intimate than if we were on the lower deck. Seats were comfortable for the journey and entertainment fine. BA cabin crew seemed rushed throughout the journey, lead purser was busy talking when guests were entering the aircraft, no hello from her or acknowledgement. Once we got to our seats, there was no space left in the overhead lockers, no help from cabin crew but didn't expect any either, they just looked on and told us where not to store our bags. Food was kept to the bare minimum for this 13.5 hour journey with 2 hot meals provided at dinner and breakfast, nothing in between. I was actually surprised to receive the second hot meal for breakfast. We got more food and snacks on our Qantas flight from Singapore to Australia, which was much shorter at 7 hours. I still cannot understand how BA are considered a 4 star airline! Qantas also a 4 star airline was much better! In all I was not disappointed with BA, as I prepared myself for the worst.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Stockholm Arlanda. BA is rapidly becoming a budget airline at premium airline prices. I'm a silver card holder and have always chosen to fly BA, primarily to maintain it. Not any more. It's not worth bothering with the galleries Lounge at Heathrow now the hot food has been replaced (most of the time) with sandwiches and cakes. The small touches like the takeaway biscuits etc. have gone too. And I'm now on my fourth time of having to stay an extra night at my end destination because there are no evening seats on the flights - even 6 weeks ahead. It's hard to raise a smile from many of the check in staff/stewards - they don't seem to care anymore. The last time I flew premium economy, the food was inedible. Just about to book with another airline on principle. I have to say I hope BA ends up learning the hard way that saving pennies will lose them pounds when customers leave.

"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to London Heathrow. Boarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcements resulting in a free for all. The flight was packed full. The inflight entertainment system didn't work for the entire flight - this is a 13 hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push back nearly 14 hours. I have noticed that BA don't seem to care about IFE not working on BA0009 and BA0010 as it has been quite usual on this route for some passengers to be complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide problem effecting all passengers. The captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it wasn't the cabin crews fault, they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction. He explained that the system had overheated - well that calms things! I do not eat the served meals on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous BA0009 flight I never want to experience again, so I was looking forward to eating the snacks which are usually available, however I was told they had been withdrawn - I was not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungry. I managed but remembered how well EVA air compare with sandwiches and even pot noodles between meals! The cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys between the two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the 4 toilets. Passengers wanting the toilets had quite a struggle to push past them. I have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concern. ie blocking doors? I also experienced sinus problems, pain and congestion which is I believe due to the air quality on Boeing 777 airplanes, the air being very dry with little humidity. I do take precautions but it has taken a month to recover from the terrible headaches, sinus pain and congestion. I only experience this after flying on 777's and there are flight crew forums on line discussing 777 air quality problems. The captain was on hand to apologise for disembarking passengers and was clearly annoyed that the plane was not fully serviceable. I complained to BA and also emailed CEO Alex Cruze having been urged to do so by the crew. My email to the CEO was forwarded to customer services, no surprises there. Customer Services who replied quickly, investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints loading food and a full compliment was not loaded hence no snacks. I was advised that the lack of IFE would be investigated by their maintenance team. They would not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but I didn't expect them to. By way of compensation I was given 3000 Avios points which to me is paltry especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers, they are worth a third of what they were a year ago and can only be used where Avios are accepted! Frankly I am disappointed in both the flight and BA's level of compensation, I have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this route. The only way to check is to fly that route again with BA, do I risk it ?

"✅ Verified Review |  Belfast to Seoul via London Heathrow. Pretty poor. Short haul connection to London was good, before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haul. Flight from London was very cramped, I'm slightly above average height but by no means a giant and I really struggled to get comfortable. Seat was too narrow, very little leg room and the space to put my feet was taken up by what I assume was the processor for the IFE system for the seat in front. The seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around 2 hours. The food was ok, nothing special. Not very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you get every few hours is hardly enough. As a child I remember the food on BA flights being very good but something has gone terribly wrong. Staff are one of the few things BA has going for it at the minute, one of the few things left from the BA of old when it was actually worthy of the name. Friendly staff on the flight and in the airport. Flew the same route with Qatar Airways a few months before and they were quite simply in a different league. One last note, you build this terminal 5 which is meant to be ""world class"". Firstly there is no smoking area, although we're constantly being told not to smoke many people still chose to. You expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we can't even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as you're normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in. I am not someone who can walk into an airport and buy a Rolex and a Gucci outfit, like most people. I recommend you set up some shops where normal people can actually afford the things in them rather than just window shop.

The attendants and crew look embarrased to be offering such a poor quality product. Cramped seats, chaotic boarding, every flight announced ""our flight is busy today so if you want to check bags"". In other words, they have crammed in so many seats there is no room for cabin luggage. Now you pay for food and even water. Two trolleys pass very slowly down the aisle because it takes so long to serve and pay for food or drink, effectively blocking access to the toilets for the whole flight. How can they let a cost-cutting CEO with no understanding of quality service run a premium priced airline. It is appalling and this is no more than a high cost carrier with low cost service - a shame to be called British.

"✅ Verified Review |  Buenos Aires to London. I was warned that BA had gone downhill, but I decided to give it a try on this long haul flight. To start with, you cannot reserve your seat prior to check-in, unless after paying over 2000€ for a business class ticket you are willing to spend some additional 90€ per leg to have your seat reserved. I call this insane, to be honest. So I waited and waited and waited till check-in opened, and made it to get a forward facing aisle seat. LATAM Lounge in Buenos Aires was nice, food average but connecting from Santiago I had the time to take a shower, with ground crew extremely nice and attentive. Boarding was sort of a mess, as BA let frequent flyers (not flying Business) board through the Business class door, so there was a flood of people moving back and forth to get to the rear of the plane; crew simply unable to handle this process, so you did not feel like being taken care of during boarding. Aircraft was a 3-class Boeing 777-300 and looked a bit ""tired"". Seat was the absolute worst part of this flight, as it is narrow, too hard to have a nice sleep, and for aisle passengers this configuration feels like having a ""wall"" on one side and being exposed to people/trolleys passing through the aisle on the other side; once flat it is a little short too (even for me, I'm 180cm high, no giant here) and narrow so you find yourself forced to sleep on a side; in addition to that when you lie down the drawer is not accessible, therefore you have literally no space to store anything, not even your glasses if you wear them. Food was just ok (I still can't understand how BA can run out of entrée options in Business class), crew very mature for such a long trip but friendly and nice, it really shows they are suffering from these cost cuts as they keep apologizing for everything that is not available or not working. Entertainment system made me smile a bit, as the selection of movies was ok but the screen was much smaller than some other carrier Economy class ones. To sum up, it was an average flight, if it was not for the lie-flat seat I would call it more a Premium Economy experience than a Business one. BA needs to improve Business class as they are well below par if compared to almost all European carriers, not even to compare the Middle East airlines.

The cabin crew were exceptional and are one thing that BA have going for them. Middle seat vacant in business class but in reality no extra leg room in the seats and if the passenger in front decides to recline you have even less room. As for the catering.

"✅ Verified Review | Stuttgart to London with British Airways. How things have changed. Passengers now queue at gate as with easyJet or Ryanair, rather than sitting and waiting to be called. Unsurprisingly, boarding in Stuttgart by agency staff was chaotic - unsure who was entitled to what. Cabin crew increasingly young and inexperienced, probably because older members have left in view of the transformation of British Airways to a budget airline. How visible this was! Few people bothered to purchase the over-priced snacks and drinks on offer. Once that was out of the way, the three cabin crew members gathered in the rear galley, chatted, and munched away at the spare food from the Business Class section which had been surreptitiously taken to the rear. At the rear I noticed that one of the two lavatories for Economy Class has now been ripped out and replaced by two seats without window. Directly opposite the one remaining toilet those passengers looked particularly unhappy - not least because of the constant queues alongside them. Everything about British Airways now is shabby, telling passengers how little they are valued. And this does not even mention the extra costs for hold luggage and for seat reservations. My ticket theoretically gave me a choice of seat, but at the appointed time there were only four choices left.

"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Nice to Gatwick. £3.00 for a sandwich in Club Class. We travel in business class, whether long haul or in Europe, for a better experience. This is even more important now, since the quality of service in economy has nosedived under the 'stewardship' of Señor Cruz. It started badly when we discovered (once more) that the flight was not at the terminal, but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus, just like a charter flight. I asked a staff member why this was so, to be told that the terminal was too small to cope, but I noticed low cost carrier Norwegian was parked on a jetty. We had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of hot meal - those at the rear of Club often have no option due to catering limitations. Passengers were offered a choice of a curry, I think (yum) or salmon (yuck). By the time the nice crew got to us only salmon was left. This is high in potassium, a fish I must avoid. I asked why the other dish had run out by the second row? ""Only two were loaded"", was the reply. ""What; two only, for the whole of Club?"". ""Yes"". I asked what else was on board, only to be told that I would have to pay £3 for an M & S sandwich from economy. Before some help from our Avios, the tickets cost £500.00. It was beyond belief that an Executive card holder should be treated this way. The (very nice) cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassed. BA should wake up before once loyal passengers swallow hard (pun) and migrate to other carriers. I'd rather fly easyJet and spend the £300 change on a nice meal.

In more than 50 years of traveling, I have not been in a worse business class. The selection of films and music is limited and the screen small. The food on the two trips was passable but nothing more and the wines less than passable unless you like plonk. I do not suppose it is much fun for the flight attendants to work in such a low class environment but they did not one thing more than was absolutely necessary, I have saved the best for last because on the return flight the temperature of the cabin was close to freezing and I wore two pullovers and a blanket and was still cold.

"✅ Verified Review |  Washington to London Heathrow return. British Airways seems to be having an identify crisis. Are they a full service or a low cost carrier? The meals have been cut back to almost nothing. Seat selection fees abound. And checked baggage fees may apply, depending upon the the type of ticket purchased. United Airlines now has a better trans-Atlantic coach product than BA. Food: On the outbound overnight flight, breakfast has been reduced to a granola bar. On the return flight, dinner was tiny. Small amounts of food in half-filled bowls, presented on a large tray, as if to emphasize the lack of food. And the pre-landing snack has been replaced with the aforementioned granola bar. Given the lack of food, BA should just switch to buy-on-board, so at least fewer people would go hungry. Flight crews seemed apologetic about the lack of food. Seat fees: I don't know of any other ""full service"" carrier that will not assign a seat in advance as part of a paid ticket. Just assume it will cost you another $40 or more per ticket on BA. Luggage fees: Completely opaque policy. On our outbound trip, we were told our tickets included one free checked luggage item. On our return we were told checked bags would be extra, although the kindly baggage check-in attendant waived the fee for us (no doubt, he too is as much a victim of BA's indecipherable baggage fee policy as are passengers). Entertainment: Boeing 777-200 outbound with good, modern, on-demand IFE system. On the return a Boeing 747-400, the system was an older on-demand system, with small blurry screens that were almost unwatchable. Cabin crews were generally friendly.

The food on the flight was absolutely disgusting and inedible. A choice of thai vegatable curry, or a chicken dish which I ate one bite of. The highlight of the meal was the two bite chocolate granache. Also, they have eliminated the second meal/snack service - all they served was tea/coffee and a cookie. Very poor indeed. Seat comfort was the best I've experienced in economy. I managed 4 hours of sleep on a 7 hour crossing. The slideable headrests allow your head not to bob.

"✅ Verified Review |  Stavanger to Las Vegas via London Heathrow. This is a salute to the fantastic staff at Terminal 3 helping my group out when everything seemed lost, because of American Airlines terrible customer service. The trip was originally meant to be a codeshare where we flew with BA booking under AA flights from LHR to LAS via JFK. The trip took place on April 3rd 2017 We risked being stranded with 16 out of 19 travelers at LHR, because of AA somehow ""magically"" losing our itineraries and not interested at all in helping, rather blaming everyone else. The BA service personnel spent hours trying to solve it, and  decided to take matters in their own hands. They got us 16 travelers on their direct flight from LHR to LAS the day after, arranging for accommodation, transport to/from the airport and Dinner / Breakfast, even though AA was mainly responsible for our journey. The service on-board was to expect from a economy flight of that duration. Seats was good, food all right, complimentary drinks and very welcome.

On the way to Moscow had seat next to emergency exit so had some leg space though the screen for entertainment as well as table were getting stuck so had to choose between watching film and having food resulting with the food provided placed on my lap and cup of coffee on the floor. The food itself was miserable - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich without alternatives whereas the crew had hot lunches with meat as I noticed while queuing for toilet (and there were only two for a fully booked economy class). On the way back to London had a seat in the middle of the cabin with so little leg space that I literally could not even cross my legs, as my knees were stuck into the seat in front. Seats were not reclining either. The food was even worse than on the inbound flight - stone-cold cheese and onion sandwich was replaced with stone-cold cheese and onion small bun and hot drinks were only served once over 4 four hours flight.

✅ Verified Review |  Copenhagen to Mexico City via London Heathrow. Upper deck window seat. British Airways uses a 2-4-2 configuration with every second seat backwards. To serve window and center seats the crew open a blind between the seats and pass food and drinks over the aisle seat. It also means you will be face to face with the passenger besides you. This could be great or horrible. Food is nothing special but service is polite. Bags did not make the flight but their representative on ground was very helpful and bags arrived next day.

"✅ Verified Review |  Prague to London Heathrow. British Airways have lost the plot. BA is now a budget airline and offers the bare minimum of services for a higher than budget fare. Check-in is ridiculous as you wait for all the other categories to be processed, such as gold members, bronze members, families, business class, silver members. They do at last get round to calling for anyone left and then it's a scowl from the shabby attendant as you board the plane. Seating is fair, though leg room is tight. The flight left a little late but arrived almost on time, which was fine. There is no food, nor even a coffee provided and a couple of flight attendants come down the aisle at a snail's pace with a trolley. I can't believe BA now make passengers pay extra for food and drink. BA shows itself up as very much a budget airline and a fr cry from its illustrious past.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Istanbul. I am ever increasingly disappointed with British Airways, the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the hard product but the staff who seem dispirited. The seats, lounge food, aircraft cleanliness, on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlines. My most recent flight back I took an aisle seat for a change. The flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets. This is really quite irritating especially during meal service. No attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints. I find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well. I think BA don't care, on the flight from Istanbul, electronic devices are banned, other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you. British Airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment, or even extra magazines on the flight.

Economy overseas is a joke too, they bring the premium drinks/service from the back to the front so economy class passengers get to see the kind of amenities they could have had. They replaced the 2nd meal they used to offer with snacks but of the options (cookies, snack-sized kit kats and snack-sized mars), you may only have one. I asked to have an extra snack, I was told no, only one. Onboard media is decent, but nothing to write home about.

"✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to London Heathrow. I have to agree with all the other reviews on here. BA have gone so far in cost cutting that the service the flight attendants are able to offer is just appalling. There's just nothing positive left to say about them. From the newly refurbished 747 that looks drab and cramped with the new uncomfortable slimline seats, to the disgusting cheap meals. The flight attendants were pleasant but you can see they're embarrassed and have nothing to offer. All this would be fine but British Airways still charges premium prices and for what? I just took a flight on the same route with Virgin Atlantic and what a difference! All the little extras that make long flights bearable are still there and the prices are cheaper.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Milan Linate. I landed in London after taking connecting flights from Orange County California to Dallas and then Dallas to London both on American. I landed in London at 1:15 P.M. This flight did not leave until 6:30 P.M. I went to the British Airways help desk and asked if I could get on the 3:00 flight. They told me to go to the gate and wait to see how full the flight was before the flight as I had only one carry one and nothing checked. I went to the gate just before boarding and they told me that it was impossible as I would have had to go to the ticket area at least an hour before to change the ticket. So I had to wait another 3 hours. I have now been traveling for 18 hours. At the gate for boarding they looked at the bag and said I would have to check it. I explained that it is a regulation carry on bag and it was on the last two flight and I have had the same bag on over 30 flights as carry on. I explained that it was on the last to connecting flights and I have been traveling for a long time and did not want to wait a long time for my bags as I will be getting in late. They were very rude and tagged the bag but still gave it to me to carry down to the tarmack and get on the bus to the plane. I decided to carry it on to the plane. It fit easily in the overhead as it has for every other flight (there were other bags that were bigger than mine. They actually came on the plane and took the bag off and put in in the cargo hold. If that wasn't annoying enough, I could not believe I asked for water to take a pill and they charged me for a bottle of water. They also charged the woman next to me for a cup of tea. I could understand this possible on one of the discount airlines but this was British Airways.

"✅ Verified Review |  Baltimore to Nice via London. My ordeal started when I could not check in online. I called BA and they said the flight is under airport control and I have to check in at the airport. Fair enough but I should have known something was wrong. When I get to the airport 3 hours ahead (I wanted to get a good seat) I was told that Premium Economy was overbooked, and that I was involuntarily being bumped to economy. Never mind that I bought and paid for the ticket 4 months ago. The staff were not even nice about it. Quite beligerent. They offered me a Compensation card for $94. Where they got this amount, I don't know. I would have preferred the seat. Then they tell me I need to contact BA for a refund of the difference in price. Why should I need to contact them? They moved me, they know they moved me, shouldn't it be automatic? So I am being inconvenienced twice because of their mistake. I did send an e-mail on their refund form and have yet to hear from them. It has been a week. I had a horrible flight. I have severe back pain (one reason I booked premium, for the extra room) which was made worse by my economy seat. My screen did not work for movies, although the flight attendants did try. It is as though they wanted to make me have a bad trip. Fast forward, while in France, I tried to use the Compensation Card, declined.  So I tried to use it on Amazon and Nespresso online. Also declined. Really BA? I sent another e-mail telling them the card is not working. Nothing. I have flown BA in the past and have been happy with the. Not anymore.  I have had it with BA. I will not fly with them again because when there is a problem, they do not come through.

"✅ Verified Review |  A business class sale convinced me to give it a try on a trip home from Sofia to Boston. I have to say that my wife, daughter and I were completely pleased, somewhat surprisingly so. Quick efficient checkin at the business class counter in Sofia. Decent contract lounge. Excellent service and food onboard both the Club Europe flight to London and Club World flight to Boston. Terrific flight attendants, and much better food than I am used to on United, LH or Austrian. I have a gluten allergy and need to order special meals. All three gluten free meals on this trip were among the best I have had. All three included flavorful sauces, which is something LH always omits from its special meals. The Galleries lounge in the B satellite terminal was excellent. Not as much food on offer as in the LH and OS lounges, or even the new UA lounge at Heathrow T2, but it was quiet and comfortable. And we really liked the quirky Club World business cabin. The middle section is great for couples, every seat has a storage drawer and the entertainment system was solid. There were four toilets for business class. My only complaint: the outrageous policy that required me to pay to reserve seats together in business class.

"✅ Verified Review |  An excellent experience on a roundtrip trip from Hong Kong to Copenhagen through London. Despite being in economy class, the flight attendants were attentive and also proactive (serving our needs before we even needed to ask). They were friendly and made us feel completely at home. The on-board entertainment selection was very extensive, with high-quality options (English and international movies of high caliber) and the screen interface was modern and easy to use. The seats on the flight from HKG-LHR on the Boeing 777-300ER were new, and much more comfortable than the average older seat. The pilot was incredibly descriptive of the flight path we were taking, and kept us up to date in terms of turbulence, arrival time, weather without being overbearing or overly disruptive. With regards to the pre-boarding/ground service, one of the check-in representatives went out of her way accommodating my boyfriend and I so that we could sit together and have a window seat (both of which were not available at check-in due to the fact that we had bought our tickets separately and had not selected seats beforehand). We really appreciated her willingness to look at what she could do to make our trip more pleasant.

The service on this flight was appalling. Travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin services i.e. drinks, towels etc.. the normal routine stuff. On too many occasions we had to request attention. Chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2 at the front of the service. Collection of waste items had to be requested. The galley kitchen was not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site, no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of water. Cabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flight. Hot towels will soon be the size of a postage stamp. Toilet bags are cheap. BA have totally lost the plot. They are no longer a premium service and Willie Walsh and Co. need to take a flight on Emirates, Qatar etc. to realise their failings. Business seating configuration is ridiculous. Passengers in the centre seats have to hurdle their way to the isle over the isle passengers legs. As part of the same trip we made domestic flights to connect. Again service is in reverse but the costs aren't. If BA wants to become a budget airline then they need to offer budget fares. I don't think they have a clue what they are doing.

"✅ Verified Review |  The flight from New York JFK to London Heathrow was extremely uncomfortable, although the entertainment was quite good on the TVs, the food was horrible, plasticy tasting, and above all not tasty. The flight from Heathrow back to JFK had many delays, although this was out of anyone's control, it was very inconvenient and there was a terribly long wait to board the new plane (5 hours). At first we were told that we would be brought to a new plane as soon as possible, but almost an hour later here were many other delays and disappointments that we were notified about. The other passangers and myself should not have to wait for hours to get on a new plane. I wish the discomfort of the plane, bad food, and time of delays were reduced dramatically.

Myself and my partner were on a flight that was overbooked and so were accommodated on a different flight on the same day with a via point of Oman. While upset about the change of trip and the delay that would occur as a result we accepted that these things happen and were told to go straight to boarding for our flight to Oman. When we asked about tickets for the second flight we were given a form of ticket and told we would have to visit the transfer desk in Oman to get our boarding passes. On arriving in Oman they had no clue who we were and the flight we were meant to be on was full. We were left there for 4 hours with no communication from anyone in a transfer unit with no shop or vending machine and no offer of refreshments.

"✅ Verified Review |  I had to change my flight back from San Diego because of an accident that required a stay in hospital. I'd flown out first class and had a business class return. I do understand why some fare structures mean that flights are not changeable, but BA were absolutely no help at all. They flatly refused to change the flight so I had to buy a ticket in the only available class - World Traveller Plus. Which cost $3,300 - one way. The first class fight to was OK - nice cabin crew and good food, but grubby cabin and clear cost cutting - no snacks, water etc in the galley like there used to be. Absolutely no help on the return trip - despite requests before the flight - because I was walking with a stick. I'd requested an aisle seat, had to ask again at check in as they had given me a seat in the middle which would have really annoyed other passengers as I tried to get across them to go to the loo etc with my stick. Really poor value at $3,300 and rubbish seats, uncomfortable and tv screens that aren't great. The food was awful - clear that costs are being cut massively. Maybe their plan is to offer such rubbish food that when they introduce food you have to buy in long haul we all feel grateful! It's a pity really. It's obviously BAs call if they want to be a no-frills airline, but I'd rather they were honest with us so that we can choose amongst the many other no frills airlines.

"✅ Verified Review |  Philadelphia to Edinburgh via Heathrow in January 2017. I've always enjoyed flying British Airways and usually make my yearly trips to Philly with them rather than flying direct to Newark via United. The long haul flight was OK - food service was a wee bit slow but it was the usual chicken and rice which was OK for an economy class flight. However, it was a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning - so the chicken was the only food we got on the flight. I wasn't too fussed about that, until I got on my connecting flight to Edinburgh where I found out that they no longer served free food! By this point, I was pretty hungry so I caved in and got ready to pay for a bacon roll, which never happened because the trolly never reached me! To top it all off, we left Heathrow late because of a computer problem, meaning I missed my train connection in Edinburgh - but I understand that these things happen at times. However, recent cuts to service and the upcoming densification of the long and short haul fleet make BA a lot less attractive. Furthermore, the headphone jack on my IFE was loose so it was quite difficult to watch films during the flight, which was disappointing. On the up side, the staff both at the desk and during the flight were great as always. Considering I got the flight for a good price, it was OK. Although I will definitely not be going out my way to fly BA and will just go for the cheapest or direct option in future.

Yes British Airways are investing but long overdue. The small lounge for B gates needs to be re-thought and offer better food options. To the aircraft - its been refitted apparently, but should be scrapped. The seats remain tired. The vanity screen was not working properly. The entertainment system is past its best, with smudges and scratches. The carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed. The toilets are 'old'. Overall, the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium. Regarding the crew - they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former selves. Sad but true. Too many apologies for the rubbish decisions of management. On this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing e.g. Waitrose fruit and yogurts. They have also stopped the ice-cream. Food served was not good - saving grace was the meat platter, but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheese. Blankets are faded and ragged. The toilet bags are a joke. Cheap and nasty. This route was the jewel in the airline crown and one that has slide down the priority ladder. BA need to invest in a new fleet. Re-energise the crew.

It seems BA is these days later in taking off. During the flight I felt like many of the staff serving were not friendly as one would expect in any flight let alone in business class, and my calls to request additional water or other quite basic service elements were not responded to with any friendliness or a service mindset. The main meal we were served was absolutely awful. It was supposed to be an Asian meal of a curry with prawns, but was just like gunge, and was not edible. I really don't know how they could have deemed this meal acceptable. Also the breakfast was far too late and seemed to be a big rush to try and complete the service before the plane landed - which seemed totally unnecessary. As I was hungry between courses I went to the galley to get snacks but the selection was poor, and the staff seemed to react badly to this for some reason. I have noticed a big difference of the snacks on offer in the past few years. I have been a BA silver member for many years but now see no reason to renew.

"✅ Verified Review |  Just got off the flight from Heathrow to New Orleans and have to say it was one of the worst long haul economy class flights I have ever had to endure. The legroom is an absolute joke for such a long flight - first time I have ever been unable to open my laptop to work (I now understand why they don't offer wifi on board!). The seats are minuscule and if you are unfortunate to be sitting next to somebody who is rather big boned shall we say, then it is a dreadful experience. In my section one of the toilets was not working from the start of the flight and the other toilet rapidly descended into a disgrace with no cleaning done throughout the flight. I have travelled a lot over the years, first, business and economy, and had a gold British Airways card, but this was just terrible and I don't really know what BA hope to achieve in the long run - I can guarantee, I will seek other airlines first before considering them again. Anybody contemplating going to New Orleans from Heathrow - fly with somebody else and get an internal connection - you won't regret it. As for BA, they have about as much chance of me booking another flight with them long haul as Trump has of winning the Nobel prize for oratory, were it to exist!

"✅ Verified Review |  We flew on a reward flight from London Heathrow to Brussels for a weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a full service experience.  We were very well looked after by superb flight attendants who had a great sense of humour. The lunch was chicken salad and a nice dessert. What we did notice is that the legroom was just the same as economy, and seemed rather worse than usual. The only perk we had was a blanked off seat in the middle, which, if you are a bit chunky like me, it was quite difficult to manoeuvre. This all tallies with what has been written in the newspapers, and we, like many other reviewers and frequent loyal flyers feel that BA is being turned into Vueling. If it weren't for the excellent pilots and flight attendants on BA who make our journeys feel very comfortable and safe, we would not travel on BA.

"✅ Verified Review |  I am just sad to have to write this review. I changed from Lufthansa to British Airways more then 10 years ago, because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way. Mostly flying between Berlin, the US and in recent years very frequently Cape Town. BA had more modern planes, innovative products like a great (rather new) First Class, lie-flat seats in Business Class, a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seats and legroom. Flying from Cape Town to Berlin in January to keep my Silver Status made me realise, that none of my initial reasons to choose BA still exists, with the exception of the great cabin staff, that I feel really sorry for. The owners hired Álex Cruz last year, a very experienced low-cost airline executive and he is doing the best he can: Turning BA into a low-cost carrier. Unfortunately. The result is a pity. No more service on short haul flights, reduced service, only paid snacks on long-haul, worn 747's to Cape Town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777's with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards. British Airways as a premium airline is lost. Realistically for year to come. Even with my status renewed, I don't think I will fly them again if I don't have to.

"✅ Verified Review | No, no, no, British Airways. You've messed up. Someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights, just like many other airlines do, and they said ""Let's provide food from M&S: that will make our offering classier than the rest."" The problem on my 18:55 flight from Marrakech to London was that — it being dinner time — loads of passengers wanted food and drink, so the service was inevitably snail-paced. A piece of friendly advice, BA, you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight, or you merely annoy your customers. Sitting near the back of the plane, my wife and I got served 2 hours into the 3.5 hour flight, by which time our tongues were hanging out. But what's this? Only two sandwiches left, and we bagged the last two packets of crisps. You're promising things you can't deliver, BA. There is such as thing as advertising standards, and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards. The 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively, even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someone's payment card failed to register on their machine. (Hint for frequent flyers: if your card just doesn't work you get your food and drink for free.) Meanwhile, behind the service trolley, a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves (a very appropriate expression in the circumstances). Other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier: several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and M&S extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight. Whoever at British Airways is employed to read reviews on this website, please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare. The process I call 'Ryanisation' of British Airways is almost complete. You now charge for checked baggage (yes, I know that's indirect, but only idiots can't see through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall, and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats, and now you've devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short haul' (what even BA used to call 'medium haul') flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane. Oh, and by the way: why don't the cabin crew deploy the A320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress? Too costly, perhaps? I suggest that BA needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan, but with a minor revision: ""British Airways, the world's least favourite airline"".",1,2017-04-07, United Kingdom ,False,review british airway messed someone sat office thought would good idea charge food drink flight like many airline said let provide food make offering classier rest problem flight marrakech london dinner time load passenger wanted food drink service inevitably snail paced piece friendly advice ba need provide cabin crew handle economy dinnertime flight merely annoy customer sitting near back plane wife got served hour hour flight time tongue hanging two sandwich left bagged last two packet crisp promising thing deliver ba thing advertising standard beautifully photographed food drink menu drive coach horse principle advertising standard cabin crew serving economy soldiered service impressively even managing smile umpteenth time someone payment card failed register machine hint frequent flyer card work get food drink free meanwhile behind service trolley phalanx passenger leg tightly crossed tried avoid exhorting cabin crew move trolley could access toilet relieve appropriate expression circumstance passenger simply wanted relieve packaging food bought hour earlier several eventually came aisle waving empty bottle extensive food packaging crew remove sight whoever british airway employed read review website please take note pas management dare process call ryanisation british airway almost complete charge checked baggage yes know indirect idiot see scam exert extortionate price unfortunate enough tall need legroom emergency exit seat devised marvellous system charged cabin service food drink short haul even ba used call medium haul flight annoys half customer board plane oh way cabin crew deploy overhead monitor display flight progress costly perhaps suggest ba need return day advertising wonderful slogan minor revision british airway world least favourite airline
"✅ Verified Review | Having only flown easyJet / Ryanair for all my short-haul journeys over the last 10 years or so, I was pleased to see a relatively low-cost BA flight for my round trip from London to Rome. In hindsight, I wish I'd booked a different airline and not booked BA based on its legacy reputation. To say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement. I expected, at the very least, an equivalent service to that of other low-cost short-haul airlines, certainly not worse. Narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm. Regardless of this, there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable. Even on a 2.5hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that, at a relatively small 5""8, my knees were grazing the seat in front. Lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse. I was also tantalised by the BA bragging of M&S supplied food. I am more than happy to pay for this on a short-haul flight and don't expect anything for free. It certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions. Sadly, being sat in row 22, this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything. No sandwiches, no fruit salad, no yoghurt. I asked what they did have. Their response 'Bottle of water or a Kit Kat'. After asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least. 'They never give us enough food. It's mad. They give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight'. Needless to say that BA can no longer live on their past reputation. They had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low-cost carriers. Sadly, they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the list. I'd say I'd give their long-haul a chance but after this experience, I won't bother. What a shame.

"❎ Unverified |  London Heathrow to Munich return. It used to be an enjoyable experience flying BA. Sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now, and travelling BA just feels like a bit of a chore. The loss of the free bar/food service on European flights is a real step down. Even worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an 'improvement' to offer paid-for M&S food on board. Oh, and how replacing my free drink with the same drink, only now I have to pay, is an 'improvement' in service is beyond me. Not even a free tea or bottle of water? (I asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). The 'card-only' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. Next on the list is the outrageous prices that BA charge to select a seat in advance. Not wishing to pay this, by the time I checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane I could choose from. I took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane, which is far from my first choice of seat. Other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and EasyJet charge about half of what BA charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with EasyJet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with BA). Check-in at T5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn't work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn't let me print a bag tag. So I couldn't use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting time. There was a minor delay due to fog, but that wasn't BA's fault and didn't have a hige impact. Flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. On the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying BA in Europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. Could we? No, the earlier flight was full. Rather than sit in Munich airport all afternoon, we rebooked on Lufthansa instead. In summary, if flying BA on European routes these days, be aware that BA is now a no-frills carrier.

"✅ Verified Review |  Belfast to Gibraltar via Heathrow return. I fly British Airways when I can and have always been impessed and satisfied - until now. The flight from Heathrow to Gibraltar was uneventful, clean aircraft, no delays, no issues - apart from the lack of drinks / snacks. I'd love to know who thought this would be a good idea. Flying short haul, there is nothing to differentiate BA from easyJet or other no frills airlines. Add to this the lack of choice on their ""menu"". There are only a couple of sandwiches, and if you don't like mayo or cheese, you're out of luck. Well done BA, you've alienated loyal customers and are hardly likely to attract new ones. The flight from Heathrow to Belfast is my main gripe. The flight was meant to depart at 1645, but was delayed to 1720, hardly a big deal right? Wrong! The gate only went up at 1650, this led me to a bus which took us to the aircraft. It was 1730 before everyone was boarded, again, hardly a big deal except that we didn't take off until 1830, which meant that my dogs had to spend an extra night in kennels as I was back too late to pick them up. The flight itself was full, which wouldn't have been too bad if there hadn't been a lady sitting a couple of rows in front of me who stank. I won't go into details, but she smelled rancid. I was a few rows back and so didn't get the worst of it, but I could see others who were closer who were not having a good time at all. Needless to say I didn't enjoy the flight at all. I would go so far as to say that it's probably the worst flight I've been on, and I've flown Monarch and easyJet. I did e-mail BA with my concerns, but they didn't bother to reply.

I was not allowed to use the one working toilet at the back of the plane for about 80 minute, a combination of food trolley blocking the aisle, then of air turbulence.

What I struggled to get my head around is after paying for business class flights, BA then expect you to pay an additional £77 per person each way to reserve seats. There were 4 of us traveling so that adds in excess of £600 to our flight cost. BA will tell you that this is free 24 hours before departure but actually 3 days before departure most seats had gone. I would expect after paying for business class that you automatically get seated together but it appears not, as there was one couple on the return flight who had not reserved seats after paying for business class and were made to stand in the galley until everybody had boarded to if there were 2 seats together.

"✅ Verified Review |  I was scheduled to fly BA208 from Miami to London on January 18th. Boarding and departure went normal, but than, close to take-off, the ordeal began. Captain announced a technical problem (at approx. 09:15 pm) and that's when the horror started. Overall, we ended up sitting in the plane until 01:00 am before we were finally allowed to leave the plane (any attempts to fix the fault failed). We were given accomodation, but that was a 45 mins drive from Miami Airport. Check-in took another 30 mins due to a long queue of stranded passengers, and the place was like a freezer. Was re-booked for a flight the next day, but downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy. Old, tatty 747, very uncomfortable seat and entertainment screen was the size a mobile phone. Worst of all, the delay of one day has forced me to add another night in London, and cancel my connection to Munich. Total additional expenses, not counting the difference between Premium Economy (which I paid for) and Economy was ~$500. Including the gap between Economy and Premium Economy probably ~$900.

For a 13 hour flight in a Premium Economy I would have assumed it would be similar to others offering, meals, mid flight snacks and other bits. I was very wrong. We had a bar service and meal, there was then nothing until breakfast (exactly the same as the Economy offering).

"✅ Verified Review |  Frankfurt to Hong Kong via London. This will definitely be my last time with British Airways, I have already changed my return ticket to Cathay Pacific. The business class experience with BA has suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitor. Short flight to Heathrow and the afternoon snack was pitiful - probably worth about $3 at most. Seat legroom is awful, and not far off the 29 inch size that Economy is being cut to. Staff onboard were friendly, and that is all. Lounge at T5 was again very poor - crowded, food choice and standards like a cheap motorway café, dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaning. The toilet was disgusting. Evening departure to HKG and went back into the terminal to find something proper to eat. Onboard the BA club world product is lousy - cheap, low quality amenities, a very poor meal choice and standard, washrooms unstocked and quite dirty, the cabin worn and scruffy. As an expat living in Germany, I have remained loyal to BA until now, but this is the last time I will waste our company money using them. It is quite clear that BA are abusing their monopoly situation at Heathrow, cutting their own costs to boost shareholder returns without giving one thought to the longer term reputation (and profitability) of the airline.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Nairobi return in February, during the industrial action. We found the crew to be friendly and attentive. The food was ok, I had the spicy chicken which I didn't much care for, it was rather unusually badly prepared, with great hunks of chicken and vegetables, just not as nice as the beef my husband was eating. On the return flight, we were 2 flight attendants down due to the strike, but they were excellent and more than made up for the missing staff. I know that there has been a lot of gripes about BA downgrading its services, but these flights were really good, and that there were lots of drinks runs during the sleep time.

London Heathrow to Edinburgh on British Airways domestic economy, check in at T5 okay although a little slow fast track security quick. I used the BA Galleries North lounge which was full but okay with hot food on offer in the mid afternoon. Boarding through A8 on to a clean looking full A319. I had seat 25A which has no window. Crew where actually very friendly as is normally the case on BA. Not a very pleasant flight due to turbulence but landed just about on time baggage off quickly so flight not too bad. The footnote to this trip is really my feelings towards BA. In order to maintain my Executive club silver status (Oneworld Sapphire) I have to take 4 BA flights each year, which I can do on domestic routes but the additional 16 or so European and International flights I take each year will be either with other Oneworld carriers or others and not BA. The management at British Airways are making false claims, when suggesting ""it's what our passengers asked for"". I travelled with BA 16 times last year and I wasnt asked if I wanted a devaluation of the BA Executive Club - or was I asked if I wanted to pay a huge extra charge to book specific seats - I most certainly was never asked if I wanted the simple snack and a coffee on UK and European flights replaced by buy your own food - neither was I asked if I mind paying for snacks on International flights.

"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to Berlin via London on miles in a mix of classes. First class check in at Toronto was good with friendly staff. A fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins. Unfortunately first lounge was full (of gold card members) and so had to sit in the Biz lounge. Good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers. Fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2A. Excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew. A weird but tasty starter of a cured / dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked. Good cheeses and all courses selected were available. After some decent sleep, a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight. T5 North lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty. Decent breakfast selection of hot rolls, fruit, cereals etc. Quick board for the flight to Berlin. Ridiculous leg room -at 30 inches max. Very cramped. Don't like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed. An ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions. On time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg. Returning to London in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever (including low cost airlines). A full A321 was cramped, insufficient bins (with one out of service) and the now infamous terrible leg room.(I understand this is to get even worse when BA moves to 180 pax on an A320 in line with charter and low cost carriers. Slow food and drink service with little take up. Some couldn't buy as no cash accepted. Not even juice, water and coffee offered for free. This penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the US and Canadian carriers look high class. The only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver. The whole plane looked fed up, subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish. Final leg to Toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand. Nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service. Poor lunch of roast chicken, weird mash and overcooked greens. Not Biz class food and pretty average. (more like economy food). Afternoon tea was fine, with a fast deplaning and bags. On the long haul legs, the IFE was identical to Christmas, poor choice, little new material - clearly even the IFE is now down graded. The biz class product - once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy. How the mighty have fallen! Experiencing four classes on four legs, showed the gulf in all classes between BA and competitors on both short and long haul. The short haul legs to / from Berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what you're getting and it's reflected in the fare and extras. With less leg room, fewer toilets, reduced quality and/or no refreshments, and a general downgrading of service, the only thing not reduced is the price. This suggests that the BA Exec and IAG only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline. The only thing left to strip customers of is the Exec Club and Avios. It's only a matter of time before this final nail in the BA coffin hits the customer at which point - I'm off!

"✅ Verified Review |  This will be my last time to book a trip with them. I booked a return trip for April 2017 from London to Istanbul a few months in advance, they ended up cancelling my 11:00 flight and moving me to the 07:00 flight which would not work for me. After the agent telling me to take time to work out a plan I left it for a few months. On calling yesterday they told me that I had accepted the changes as it was months ago I told her that the other agent suggested that I wait and decide later. This was followed by the fact that I had purchased a cabin bag only fare, but I travel with a iPad or laptop, with the recent electronics ban BA were going to force me to pay £50 for a bag to check my device. Although this was not my fault. To add to this everything is paid for now, reduced legroom, pay for seats and no way to change them even on check in, I can see no reason to fly BA any longer.

"✅ Verified Review |  Heathrow Terminal 5 is a great airport, dedicated to British Airways, the check-in service was not as fast as they say, it was normal. The BA staff on the ground were cheerful and happy to help. I was very excited to fly on the new Dreamliner from London Heathrow to Dubai, but my dreams were crushed within my first few steps onboard. First the IFE felt very old and not clear at all, something you'd expect on non-refurbished B777's. Choice of movies and TV Shows are pretty good so I can't fault BA on that. The seats are nice, the head rest is excellent and leg room is okay. Cabin Crew are lazy and just do not want to serve us, I was waiting more than 7 minutes for someone to come to my bright light hovering above my head. The food is okay (Your first meal) its hot and options were good, two meats and nothing more you could ask for on a plane. However and this is a big however, your second meal we were given a Breakfast Bar, that was disgraceful! How much of a budget are they on now? I thought maybe something happened to the food so they gave us Breakfast bars instead, but on the return journey we were given a cookie for Lunch, people were laughing and looking at their cookies in disgrace. I just can't believe how downhill BA has gone. It's incredible how the airline now charges for shorthaul flights too, I think they're running out of money.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Dublin. I had not flown with British Airways for over 12 months but recently made the mistake of booking with them to fly out to Dublin from London Heathrow Terminal 5. It all started again, I had downloaded the BA app from the Apple App store and I tried to check in the night before using the app but I was getting the error message saying that it was not possible for me to check in at that time, I thought nothing of it and tried again in the morning when I was sat in the Taxi to the airport. On the app I noticed that the flight had been delayed by approx. 1 hour and some minutes (considering it is a local flight and I was flying with hand luggage only) I decided to stop so that I can get some food as having flown multiple times in the past 3 months (at least once and sometimes twice every week) I was under the impression that as long as I am at the airport an hour and 15 minutes before the flight then there should not be any issues (after all that's the whole point of flight updates?). When I got the BA self service machine with 55 minutes remaining in the original flight timing (and almost 2+ hours before the actual flight time) I had issues printing my boarding pass and was told by the helper to go to Zone E to get a Boarding pass printed by the counter staff, after waiting 20 minutes in the queue (bearing in mind that the flight was delayed by an hour and so there was still over 1.5 hours remaining until flight take off) I was told that the flight has been closed and as I was not there an hour before the flight time they can not help me and I ca not fly on that flight so I will have to take the next one (from 8am flight I was moved to 11am flight). After discussing with the check in manager I was told that there is nothing he can do as he doesn't make the rules. Needless to say that I had to book onto the next flight despite being through security and in the waiting area over an hour before the actual flight took off. If this is how the BA customers are to be treated, i.e. they have to be there on time for the original flight despite getting notification that the flight is delayed then I for one will most definitely not be flying BA again, the rules are to be helpful towards the customers and not one way traffic as it seems in this case (they are not putting any value on my / other customers time i.e. we must wait inside the airport like idiots despite knowing that flight is massively late ).",4,2017-03-20, United Kingdom ,False,review london dublin flown british airway month recently made mistake booking fly dublin london heathrow terminal started downloaded ba app apple app store tried check night using app getting error message saying possible check time thought nothing tried morning sat taxi airport app noticed flight delayed approx hour minute considering local flight flying hand luggage decided stop get food flown multiple time past month least sometimes twice every week impression long airport hour minute flight issue whole point flight update got ba self service machine minute remaining original flight timing almost hour actual flight time issue printing boarding pas told helper go zone e get boarding pas printed counter staff waiting minute queue bearing mind flight delayed hour still hour remaining flight take told flight closed hour flight time help ca fly flight take next one flight moved flight discussing check manager told nothing make rule needle say book onto next flight despite security waiting area hour actual flight took ba customer treated e time original flight despite getting notification flight delayed one definitely flying ba rule helpful towards customer one way traffic seems case putting value customer time e must wait inside airport like idiot despite knowing flight massively late

"✅ Verified Review |  My last few experiences with British Airways have been extremely disappointing, they just do not offer the level of service that customers used to enjoy. On my most recent trip from London to Toulouse, I booked using my Avios points. I then had to cancel the outward trip for personal reasons and was charged extra to do so, so I ended up spending more on 1 flight than I had for 2. They now charge for food and drink on shorthaul flights, I even had to purchase a bottle of water. This is akin to a LCC such as Easyjet, but the fares are still much more expensive. In addition, I received an email from the airline saying they had tried to contact me and could I contact British Airways about my booking.

"✅ Verified Review |  Orlando to London. I had booked business class and I wanted to be comfortable. Unfortunately, with British airways I paid all these money and at the end I was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again. I checked in 24 hours before the flight, as soon as the online check in opened. The system gave me only a single seat, opposite to the direction of the airplane, with no possibilty to be able to change it. I called British Airways main office to try to sort this out, initially I was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to British Airways at the airport, as airport keeps some business class seats. I called again the main office to talk to a different person, in case I was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the Aeroport. As soon as I arrived at the airport, at the check desk I was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me, however they were going to fix it at the gate. When I arrived at the gate, I was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats.

"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London. I have travelled BA numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when I was returning from Hyderabad to London from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin. While the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem, the manner in which the BA staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing. I have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines, and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles. In this instance with British Airways, I was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me. When I asked if I could be put on another comparable flight I was shut down and told ""no, this is not possible"" without any explanation. When I then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline I was told again and again ""no, this is not possible"". After realising that British Airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation I asked what could be done given the circumstances. My answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing I could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service (ticket class) I had purchased. After the flight I filed a claim with British Airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience, but I have yet receive even one response, only adding to my understanding that British Airways does not value myself as a customer or my business.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Chicago. In my opinion British Airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within Europe and Internationally especially as an economy passenger. They are moving more towards being a budget airline. There is no option of a free seat selection, they charge for food on board on short haul flights. On long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal. Avios and Tier Point awards have been slashed. I will not be flying BA any more and will be taking my money elsewhere.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Vancouver return. British Airways is no longer good value for money. The cost of Premium Economy compared with the quality of service, food, and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise. The plane in both directions was old and shabby, staff are fine, but don't really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience. Particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened (of course, you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40-£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand). The food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the Premium Economy cabin. The tv screens are dirty and small (the system had to be reset on the flight out, took quite a while).

"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.

"✅ Verified Review |  This is my first time flying on BA's A380 daily service between London Heathrow and Singapore. I chose a seat on the upper deck of the A380 - seat 70A, an exit row seat. Located just behind World Traveller Plus, this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out. The inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies. The classical music selection was severely limited though. BBC News was on the menu but ironically, it was not available for some strange reason. Inflight service was basic. There was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner. In other words, you would have to order your orange juice/Coke and wine at the same time. Cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal. Throughout the night of this red eye flight, I did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks. The LHR - VCE route was operated by the A320. British Airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its European routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and M&S snacks. On the whole, BA will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class. Unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist, I would choose another airline.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it.

"❎ Unverified |  Oh dear: cost-cutting on British Airways has led to them becoming an embarrassment. Flew Kuwait to Edinburgh via London. Aircraft are still comfortable, timekeeping is good, and information from the flight deck is always forthcoming. However, most of the cabin crew were ""mature"", and the food and drink offering is now minimal. Breakfast from Kuwait was eggs mixed with vegetables (no, not the omelette we used to have) plus mushrooms and potatoes both prepared as a mushy sort of tortilla: both looked like something you would spoon out of a tin for a baby. ""Lunch"" was a mars bar or similar. I did not bother with the ""buy on board"" stuff on the flight to Edinburgh - I get a better choice in the terminal when I get off the aircraft. The domestic flight back from Edinburgh to Heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew I have ever seen on BA, giggling at each other during the safety demonstration - very unprofessional. The evening meal out of London back to Kuwait was more like a snack, with a smallish steak, three snap peas, three baby carrots (I counted the things), and another babyfood potato thing. ""Breakfast"" was a muesli bar. Sorry guys: a comment on this board that BA equals ""Budget Airline"" just about sums it all up. I have other choices from the Gulf back home, and next time I will be thinking about taking one of them: the only attraction with BA is the extra legroom in Premium Economy, the choice of entertainment, and the direct flight to Heathrow rather than having to fly down the Gulf and return.

"❎ Unverified |  London Heathrow - Pisa return. I fly this route often as I have a house in Tuscany. I fly British Airways Club Europe only because the FAs are better, the lounge is a welcome benefit - and if you book far ahead enough - you can get a reasonable deal plus Avious points. That aside there is little benefits to flying say Ryanair. The trip started at T5 and the Northern lounge was not, for a change, to busy. Had a fruit and coffee breakfast. The options were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon baps - dripping fat all over the place. Some years ago - BA provided some nice scrambled eggs. Now they don't. Flight left from the ""A"" terminal and we boarded ""downstairs"" from the lounge. The plane was half full. It was clean and valeted. We pushed back 10 minutes early. My wife had a sort of brunch thing, cheese and ham + rolls. She said it was ok. I had a couple of Gin and Tonics. The FA said she had never seen such an empty flight - and neither had I for that matter. The now chargeable food and beverages in Economy went down like a lead balloon apparently. I read the BA ""Brochure"" on the now chargeable food and as a Sales and Marketing professional - It was the most patronising piece of rubbish I'd ever read. It read as if BA were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of all. And goodness me - the products are not cheap - over a £1 for a kit kat. We landed ahead of time and has to walk the tarmac like Ryanair customers. Several years ago you had the air-bridge. Now you don't. The return flight started in the shared lounge which was rammed. This in part is due to Qatar airlines operating out of Pisa and their Business Class customers use the same facility. Some booze and snacks - nothing edible. Flight delayed by 30 minutes. Plane was rammed. Very pleasant FAs. Afternoon tea - with horrible dried out sandwiches + scones that didn't look like scones. On both flights - the usual three seats with the centre seat being a table. No legroom. Hopelessly inadequate product which can be as high as £600 return.

I specifically booked all the flights through BA so as to avoid any issues with transitions between carriers e.g. having to pick up baggage en route. THe non BA flights were arranged (I discovered subsequently) with non-partnered airlines, with no instructions or PNR's - trying to find out what the PNR was in order to get a boarding pass was an adventure as BA checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flight. ""We can't give you a boarding pass - its not a BA partnered airline"" - ""But BA did all the booking!"". Blank look and total non-helpfulness. ""Try in Heathrow"". I eventually phoned and got the PNR and checked myself in with a boarding pass. Similarly on the way back, there was no instruction to the point that BA wanted me to confirm my bags in Mumbai before getting on the LHR flight. When I got to the gate, the BA staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bags. The fact that no-one told me to do so seemed to be lost on them. Essentially despite BA being the travel agent here, it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do. The flights out were not too bad - fairly empty business class, and staff were accordingly attentive, aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice. On the way back - forget it. Firstly - no overhead luggage space because it was filled with BA stuff - it wasn't the 'for airline use only' at the front - it was row 11! When I asked them to shift that, I was met with resentful suggestions that I could find space elsewhere on the plane. I was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class, I did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat - and that I wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space. Done with bad grace. They then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight - an overnight request for a cup of tea (I skipped dinner to sleep) took 20 mins. The breakfast was truly awful - one of the worst airline meals I have ever had. The seats are tight - I endorse all the concerns of the 2-4-2 configuration. I'm 6 ft 5, but keep myself fit and I'm not fat. I have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the BA version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable. Yes, its flat - but its short, and tight, and lumpy! Lufthansa, Ethihad, Emirates, Singapore, EVA, Thai, Cathay Pacific - all do much better than this - even Delta and American Airlines internationals are much better. Generally, the BA experience is unhelpful, uncomfortable and shabby. I'm embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services. Its not because they are so much cheaper than others. Finally, I'm now sitting in one of the BA lounges at terminal 5, and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns, porridge, and muesli. What happened to the cooked breakfasts they offered four years ago? (the last time I flew BA).

The staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers, ""no nothing could be done"". We enquired the cost of two Economy seats home whereupon we told the two Economy tickets would come to an eye-watering $5092 or £4243 Economy.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare and my experience was wonderful. There were a few problems checking in at Terminal 5 (there was an issue with some of the luggage belts at check-in running slow - never mind these things happen). We were given information about what was happening and staff were doing their best. Fast-track security was fast. Made my way to the lounge in South Terminal which was busy but I was able to find a quiet spot. Lots of food and drinks on offer but I stuck to water as I knew would be eating on the plane. Had to go to a gate in B terminal - this was my first time at Terminal 5 so asked how to get to the gate, very easy instructions given and transportation via the transit train. Boarding was easy although I didn't use the priority boarding service (my bad missing the announcement). I paid extra so I could pre-book my seat (63J) on the upper deck and really glad I did. Our cabin crew were wonderful, so attentive and polite and nothing seemed any bother for them. The food was good for airplane food and the pink champagne was very nice! I managed to get a couple of hours sleep which is very unusual for me. There's lots of room and the upper deck is limited to a maximum of 20 passengers so it feels very private. The window seats have lots of storage but unless you are in 62 or 64 A/K you have to climb over your neighbour's foot stool/legs to get in and out of your seat. 63J is an aisle seat so less private but lots of room as it's by an exit door (ideal for anybody over 6ft). There is a long not too high drawer to place items (I put a pair of knee-length leather boots in there without any issue and there was room for more) and there's the overhead lockers.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Mumbai. I've been a loyal BA customer for several years, but this was a journey of disappointment. I was late to the airport due to delays on the train line. Called customer services while on my way, and after 15min of wait I was told they couldn't do anything about it, but gave me the number of the airport. It was incorrect. At Terminal 5 I asked the attendant for help given the rush. He was quite rude and said I had to join the queue unless I was flying business. At the gate, we had a late boarding because 'the computer wasn't working'. I was flying premium economy and let me say, on this flight (BA0199) it is like the economy class of several other airlines.  Plus this 777 was in desperate need of a refurbishment. My headrest was hanging down the seat, the screen was filthy and its arm broken so it wouldn't stay in position. The flight attendant (who I never saw smiling for the entire flight) said he had reported it on the way in. I asked to change my seat. In my new seat the headphone audio had regular loud cracks and pops (it wasn't the headphones, I tried mine too). The entertainment system was poor. It started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing, plus the 'noise cancelling' headphones are NOT noise cancelling - try pulling the jack out and it doesn't make a difference. Overall a very poor experience, crowned by a terrible breakfast. Sorry BA but you are stuck in the 80s and you're slipping further down my list of preferences.

"✅ Verified Review |  San Jose Costa Rica to London Gatwick. We were firstly unable to get two seats together at online check-in. The next day at the airport we asked the clerk if we could have our seats together and he refused. I argued my case that we had paid a lot of money for these flights. After about ten minutes he showed the seating plan to his supervisor who immediately approved changing us to be seated together. I later found out the two BA employees, travelling either for free or at a drastically reduced rate had been given the seats originally and were eventually, after a great deal of argument moved. I have complained to BA and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it doesn't in the future. Next up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flight. My IFE didnt work, they offered to move me, ironically to swap with one of the BA employees but I declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sit with my wife. Choice of starter also not available but that was no big deal. Dreadful, stressful experience for people who'd paid a lot of money. Have been called by Customer Service who have offered us 10000 Avios as compensation, enough for a night at the Holiday Inn Express! Awful company to deal with, totally dismissive of customer need.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Miami. I paid £50 extra for an exit seat - this is the best thing to do. Make sure you get the one closest to window, mainly because no-one stands there to stretch their legs etc. You get unlimited leg room and the ability to stand up and wander / stretch whenever you want, and it is good value on a ten hour flight. The seats on the A380 are narrow, the entertainment system the usual etc. The meals were fine. My major issue with British Airways economy is their penny pinching. You sit down, there is no welcome snack - you then have your meal and  seven hours later if you are hungry, you have to pay for basic snacks. It's ridiculous. On American Airlines they put out boxes of pretzels, biscuits etc which you can just help yourself to. If you have a diet coke, on American you get a full 330ml can, on British Airways you get the small version.

"✅ Verified Review |  Lisbon to London Heathrow. Now that BA have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights, they might as well rebrand to a budget airline. Over the last few years, leg room across European flights (business and economy class) has decreased, to the point where it now practically the same as any budget airline. That said, it is in practice worse than budget airlines, because at least the main budget carriers have done the decent thing of removing the seat recline button, eliminating further discomfort. Even without the seat in front reclined, anyone taller than 5' 8"" will be packed in tightly on any European short-haul flight. The staff are friendly and polite. However, they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinks/food sales service, especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours 30mins. This does not only result in thirsty / hungry customers, but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolleys in the aisle blocking access to the toilets. Business class (which I sometimes use) is offered a free meal and drinks, all of a reasonable quality. However, in terms of legroom / seat size there is no benefit compared to economy. The only reason I continue to fly BA is because I have fairly set routes and BA generally fly at times which suit me. Otherwise, I get little in the way of added value. The benefits of Avios points and moving up membership tiers are hardly worth it (in monetary terms), particularly if one mostly flies within Europe. It is much cheaper to get a lounge membership (many are valid for most European - and beyond - airports), rather than remain loyal to BA these days. I have been flying with BA for well over a decade now, on a monthly basis. My sympathies go to the staff, because I fear cost-cutting will get them next, which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews maintain to this day.",4,2017-02-24, United Kingdom ,False,review lisbon london heathrow ba started charging food drink short haul flight might well rebrand budget airline last year leg room across european flight business economy class decreased point practically budget airline said practice worse budget airline least main budget carrier done decent thing removing seat recline button eliminating discomfort even without seat front reclined anyone taller packed tightly european short haul flight staff friendly polite however often struggling pas whole economy cabin drink food sale service especially plane full flight hour min result thirsty hungry customer also almost permanent presence service trolley aisle blocking access toilet business class sometimes use offered free meal drink reasonable quality however term legroom seat size benefit compared economy reason continue fly ba fairly set route ba generally fly time suit otherwise get little way added value benefit avios point moving membership tier hardly worth monetary term particularly one mostly fly within europe much cheaper get lounge membership many valid european beyond airport rather remain loyal ba day flying ba well decade monthly basis sympathy go staff fear cost cutting get next doubt detriment high standard crew maintain day
"✅ Verified Review |  Berlin Tegel to London Heathrow. I decided to give British Airways a chance for a short weekend trip to London, because when it comes to prices they cannot beat the low-cost airlines. And what do you know? I had a part of the low-cost experience paying a bigger price: no checked-in luggage included (not even as a oneworld Emerald) and you had to pay for your inflight snacks and beverages. A plus is that the prices for the snacks and drinks were not as high as with other airlines that have introduced this service lately and the quality was good. The prices were even below airport ones. The bad thing was indeed that they needed a lot of time to deliver all the products (people were buying stuff) and it took ages until you could get your order - well, you can't compete with Ryanair trying to do better the things they do best. I really miss the days when British Airways was offering tea nad coffee for free and a little snack, it was a pleasure to fly with them and I would be happy to get back to those days. Some good things about the flights was that they landed ahead of schedule, boarding was very efficient, which is a big plus and the seats were gorgeous, a lot of space, very comfortable leather seats.

I feel it was the worst airline so far compared to others. Can you imagine that they even did not give a cup of water to the passengers for 3.5-hour flight from Istanbul to London.  They explained it by economical concerns. What is the economical benefit not to serve a cup of water? Also, from London to Vancouver, we delayed almost 2 hours because of luggage issues and a passenger did not feel well and he had to leave the plane, which could be understandable this part.

"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to London in premium economy. Easy check in and fast track security meant I was in the lounge within 15 mins. Unfortunately, they were clearing up and restocking from the earlier flight. Poor choice of stale sandwiches and soup on it's last legs. I let the front desk know, and the staff made me a fresh sandwich. Also, beers had changed with 5 lagers and Newcastle Brown. The Manager fetched some IPA from the first lounge - some really good customer service which is typical in this lounge. The most disorganised boarding ever with few PAs. Onboard, juice or water offered. I asked for sparking wine but it's only done on flights from London - (crew explained it can't be chilled at outstations - (poor excuse given they do it for Club and First). Fast service after take off with an ok entree. Poor salad, and a nasty dry piece of cake. IFE was the same as my trip over Christmas so it seems the IFE is updated less often. Tea, coffee and juice offered before landing. But no muffin or even a biscuit - really poor. Prompt disembarking and bags beat me to the baggage belt. Return a week later was a better flight. Easy check in again and no fast track queue. North Lounge was an average experience, ok choice of sandwiches but not particularly clean and in need of a refresh. Bused to aircraft, a Boeing 787-9, with premium economy only half full. A half glass of prosecco was offered and a requested top up was forgotten. Fast bar service by excellent cabin crew who offered good customer service. An ok meal with a rancid coleslaw, ok steak and a tiny pot of desert. Generous with the drinks. Unfortunately, the dropping of afternoon tea at the back is inexplicable and really poor judgement by BA. I was offered T&Cs plus a breakfast bar or malt loaf finger. The crew were genuinely embarrassed (a couple of sandwiches I liberated from the club lounge made up for it). Fast off the plane, and despite slow immigration, the bags beat me again. Overall the flight was ok but certainly not up to the standard of premium economy on competitors. The meal is nowhere near Club standard and its the cutting of the small things - nibbles, breakfast and afternoon tea which irk me the most. Be competitive but don't take it out on me! I wouldn't mind but the prices don't go down with the reduction of service. Despite what the CEO maintains - it is not in response to customer feedback.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Stuttgart. Fly in comfort and style is the slogan of British Airways, but there is not much of either around these days. Not willing to pay an extra £8, I was allocated a middle seat right at the rear. At the gate an announcement was made for volunteers to check in their hand-luggage ""at no extra cost"". Within a minute a burly employee told me I had to check in my cabin bag, saying ""you should not believe what is said on the company's website"". How very true! Some ten other passengers, equally perplexed suffered the same fate. I know there were ten, because another employee kept counting us and saying ""we need ten"". The burly employee was later to be found on the airbridge to make sure that we really did hand over our cabin bags. All in all a demeaning experience. The seat rows are now more tightly packed than before. Although of average slim build, I found the seat a tight fit. Only a few passengers took up the offer to purchase food or drink (the deceptive ""upgrade"" we were sold at the beginning of the year). But still, did not reach the back of the plane until shortly before landing. Not only have the complimentary food and drink disappeared, but also newspapers and priority boarding for those of us who are frequent flyers. On the return journey I noticed part of the reason for this new policy: the Stuttgart ground staff have now been replaced by agency staff.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Rome return. Race to the bottom. My first time with the new buy onboard service. I was not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment. Basically it does not work. I can understand in some ways why they decided to offer a wide range of food options. I would have accepted this if they had kept the free drinks. Even soft drinks are chargeable - I don't think this is acceptable. However, despite the extensive menu, there was an extremely limited selection available. One crew member came round soon after the flight took off and took orders for hot food. There was a 20-25 minute wait time for this. The crew then came around with the drinks trolley. This was extremely slow. The payments could only be made with credit cards or Avios points.

"✅ Verified Review |  Edinburgh to London City. Despite having a confirmed booking, when I attempted to check-in with a prepaid-for bag at 1535 at the EDI airport for a 1655 flight to LCY (domestic flight) I was told I couldn’t as the flight had been oversold. I accepted an offer to switch to a later flight on the same route with Flybe and take compensation but then was told the compensation couldn’t be authorised so I had to ‘wait’. I then stood around for 10 minutes, being asked to ‘move out of the way’ at one point because I was blocking others. I was not given a copy of the compensation scheme details (despite what the BA website claims should be done) and the staff seemed unclear of it themselves. I was simply ignored until I approached the desk again and insisted to speak to a supervisor. None was available nor could be contacted, apparently. I wasn’t allowed to transfer to the Flybe flight “in case” a seat became available on my original flight, so they tagged my luggage but did not check it in. I was told to wait for another 20 minutes. I argued this was not fair to leave me in limbo given I had a confirmed booking in the first place but I was basically ignored and informed this flight is regularly oversold and it’s not their problem that other people had checked-in before me. I was treated as a nuisance. At one point, there were 5 members of BA check in staff doing nothing (nobody else to serve) whilst I was just standing silently there ‘waiting’ and being ignored. After 20 minutes of not knowing what to do, my original flight closed and I was approached by a supervisor (who suddenly was available to talk to me) and given a seat. I asked how it was that a seat has magically appeared if earlier I had been told the flight was already full with no seats available. He explained that the seats had been prepaid for by others who had then not checked in, and as the check-in was closing, they could give me the seat now. I informed him that I resented having been treated rudely by his staff earlier (though the supervisor himself was professional and courteous) and that his staff are untrained to deal with overbookings. I had done nothing wrong to deserve being treated so shabbily, like a problem rather than a customer. I then had a predictably stressful rush through security to ensure I was not denied boarding at the gate for being late (even though I had arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare originally, especially for a domestic flight). As I told the supervisor, if the airline treats its customers with such contempt, do not be surprised that the public ends up viewing the airline with contempt. Under their current policy of overbooking, passengers who do not pay more to reserve a seat in advance are at risk of not getting a seat at all, even though they have a confirmed booking. Some would call this cheating. The saving grace of the experience was that the flight was punctual, and unlike mainline BA, this route is run by its subsidiary BA CityFlyer which still offers complimentary drinks and a snack for which the cabin crew service was efficient.

"✅ Verified Review |  This a tale of two airlines and their individual approaches to Business Class passengers. We were flying to Mauritius on holiday and I felt, given the flying time, we should spoil ourselves and fly up-front with all the 'comparative' comfort of Business Class. The British Airways flight itself was okay, the crew friendly and the cabin worked fine. However, I was totally shocked by the standards of catering in the Gatwick Lounge (a small issue for some perhaps, but for me, it's all part of the Business Class experience). To illustrate my point, I attach a shot of what Walsh's policy of putting shareholders first actually means for fare-paying passengers. With the very confusing layout that greets one in the South Terminal now that BA have moved in, the 'serve yourself' check-in (you even label your own bags!). I was pretty frustrated by the time we actually found the 'Lounge'. But then to be greeted with this, was totally unacceptable. So, Willie, rather than screwing down costs for the benefit of your shareholders, this sort of display of overt cost-cutting has now lost you revenue for the future. Short-sighted management or what?

Attendants said it was the quietest they had every seen. Given that I was on an A380 it really did look empty. Food and service was good both ways and the aircraft was only a couple of years old. Plenty of room on the downstairs cabin and the overhead lockers seemed larger than any other airliner I'd flown on. I was given an exit row seat which was very welcome. BA usually charge £58 for this seat. It meant about 5 foot of legroom and because the next cabin in front was business class the toilets were curtained off for the entire flight meaning the area was very quiet. No real gripes although the ""snack"" served about an hour before landing has been downgraded from a small meal to a tiny Twix chocolate and a cup of coffee.

"✅ Verified Review |  The quality of British Airways has most certainly gone downhill. On short haul from London Heathrow to Rome it is nothing more than that of easyjet. Online check in was quick and easy, and terminal 5 is a delight however online check in is only available 24 hours before departure unlike easyjet which allows for check in 30 days prior to departure. That was the only good part of our journey. We boarded a packed old 767 which was decaying with the middle seat (E) so narrow it was impossible to get in and out of the seat in flight. (We were in row 13). Without notice, we had to go through de-icing which meant a 45min delay to our service (we did however catch up 35mins). Our inbound flight was on a newer A319 which had better seats and a skymap. Due to slot restrictions at Rome and London, this flight was also delayed. During both flights the new buy on board was poorly done, taking forever with a limited range of overpriced products. I therefore can only conclude that the airline that once one just 10 months ago offering meals on short haul flights as well as always being on time is now nothing more than a low cost carrier with older planes and a useless service.

Immediately on reaching cruising altitude, we were informed that they were now serving ""lunch"". At 10am. We were told that we would be given sandwiches on descent, this on a 7 hour flight. A cynical person might think that the crew wanted to get meal service out of the way early. I don't know what timezone ""lunch"" was in, possibly Bangkok, but certainly not Doha or London time. After 5 hours I rang the bell. The female cabin crew person came and asked incredulously, ""did you ring the bell""? Yes, once, the entire flight. I asked for the sandwich and she told me that I would have to wait. No, I want it now. Not a five course meal, a sandwich. Having just flown on Qatar Airways where the entire menu is a la carte and you can order anything at any time, apparently a pre-prepared sandwich was a big ask. In business class.

He said the only thing he could do was give me a partial refund which would be useless as it was $2k to buy a new ticket or I could fly out on 1/4/17. I asked if British Airways would comp my hotel for their mistake. He said no and I asked how he expected me to pay for a hotel for 4 more nights. He had no answer. He refused to book me on any other airline. I asked for a manager he said there were none available. I fought with BA from 5pm until 1am (no exaggeration, I have screeenshots of the phone calls). I decided to get up at 6am, go to the airport, and talk with a BA rep - only to find out they have no BA reps but a rep representing a BA rep. She told me at first she could do nothing either and I told her I did not care where in the US she got me just get me to the US. She managed to get me a flight to Philadelphia the next day. She comp'd my hotel for the night and all meals. As a business who has inconvenienced me should. However, she failed to tell me that my flights were not connected and I had to individually check in to each one. The check-in associate also failed to do so. Therefore, when the stewardess for AirBerlin was 30 minutes late and made us delayed quite a bit, I had to run to the next gate only to find out I wasn't checked in so they gave my seat away.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro. 45 minute delay on the tarmac. Air conditioning wasn't working during delay - would only work once engines were on. The cabin was therefore unbearably hot. The foam in my seat 30B had deteriorated to the point I could feel the metal bar underneath digging into my tail bone. I informed the cabin staff of this - but due to the flight being overbooked, I couldn't be moved and so I was given an extra pillow. This is a 12 hour flight and I don't think this is acceptable. I was very uncomfortable during this flight. In flight entertainment kept pausing and pixelating/blipping. In flight snacks now have to be paid for. Considering the price of flights, I think this is very poor. British Airways is not a budget airline. In fact airlines currently rated lower than BA in the Top 100 airlines (eg Virgin Atlantic and Malaysian Airlines) still provide complimentary on board snacks. There were two in flight meals on this flight - on both occasions I was not offered the meal of my choice as it had run out. Once, I could forgive - but twice? When I complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion (keep in mind this was at the end of the flight when I had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal bar for 10 hours) - the steward informed me that 'I was travelling to a poor country and I should be grateful for the food I was getting'. How rude! I do not book flights with BA to get lectured by your flight staff. The quality of the meals have dropped dramatically. No crackers or cheese, no fruit. What is now served with the mail meal is coleslaw and fruitcake (both of which I intensely dislike). This is what made the unavailability of complimentary snacks on the flight even more upsetting.

The flight got cancelled due to bad weather at IST, this is understood,  but when we tried to reschedule the flight, we faced a mess and nightmare with the staff who did not know how or what they should do as Istanbul airport was shut due to snow. We nearly got rebooked on a flight to Munich which we refused as BA ticketing agent did not know that the Turkish incoming flight to Munich was cancelled - I had to show her where to look on the web before making us travel to Munich where we would have got stranded.

When finally we got the option to travel Via Athens, We had to go and collect our luggage, When we asked for the Pre-Arranged assistance for my Mother, we were told No assistance was available due to the facts that there were many people needed help. We had to walk the very long distance back through immigration from BA’s lounge at T5. We went to what was marked as Luggage Desk (Club Word), were told to go alone to collect our luggage out of nearly 2000 pieces of luggage because other flights were cancelled.

I have just started flying again with British Airways and, just recently, the Bordeaux to Gatwick route, once served by a 737-400 and now replaced by the more modern A320. To my surprise the cabin looks very nice (although the leg room seems to have reduced to that of Ryanair) and has a pleasant feeling. Sadly discovered one has to pay for wine and food on board now (economy) but the wines are not good (I am a wine trade professional). If the food is ""M&S"" concept, why don't they get M&S to supply them the wines too? Years ago the selection process at British Airways was different and the wines were then great! But overall my flight to Gatwick was enjoyable, the crew professional, and hardly more expensive than EasyJet on the same route. My next BA trip is on February 18th, this time to Shanghai.

"✅ Verified Review |  Heathrow to Hong Kong in Business Class on 3rd January as part of a holiday to New Zealand, also involving flights with Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines. The flight to Hong Kong with British Airways showed up all that is bad about British Airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlines. The continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flight. Check-in at Terminal 5 was chaotic, there having been a ""computer glitch"" which greatly slowed the check-in and bag drop processes. There were too few BA staff on hand to assist and those that were in evidence were being continually harassed. Business check-in was better but still very busy. BA needs to speed up bag drop urgently. Other airports allow you to print your own baggage labels and take your baggage straight to be loaded onto the conveyor belt where a member of staff checks the weight to make sure it is not too heavy, not perfect for all passengers but would considerably speed up the process for the vast majority of passengers who can check in easily. The lounge was a disappointment with tired dirty furniture, used dishes not being cleared, too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availability. Not a great place to rest before an 11 hour journey and I would concur with other comments about the deteriorating standards. Compare this to the other ""home"" lounges of other carriers such as those at Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur. Took a shower whilst waiting and that was OK. The flight was not good at all. Cabin crew showed general lack of interest throughout the flight and seemed interested in just getting the meals served and then disappearing from view for the rest of the flight until it was time for the meal service prior to landing. Gone are all the small (and not so small) touches that made flying with BA a pleasure, such as hanging up coats, hot towels, a second round of drinks, a nice meal at a leisurely pace and an overall feeling of being well looked after. A comment about the seats, how can BA justify 8 across in Business Class? When the ying/yang seats were first introduced they were a revolution, but a lot of other airlines now only have 6 across with a lot more space and comfort and in most cases you don't have to climb over another person to get out whilst they are sleeping. I had a window seat and I felt very hemmed in. There was no storage space for the things you need during a flight, glasses, tablet computer, water bottle etc. All were kept on the floor or crammed down the side of the seat. Sadly BA is no longer my airline of choice. I spent many years doing international business travel and when you saw the Union Flag on the tailfin at some distant airport you knew you were already nearly home. I saved a considerable number of Avios points for my retirement which I am now using up, but on other airlines within the One World Alliance where possible and who offer a far better product and actually look after their passengers and make them feel wanted. Sorry BA but you've lost my loyalty. Club World is now very poor (and also Club Europe now) and you've lost the plot to the bean counters.

Once onboard, for a two hour flight, I was served afternoon tea which consisted of three finger sandwiches, a scone and a really small slice of cake. This meal was completely insufficient. There was one drinks round offered and one top up offered. Given that BA use the smallest glasses possible, coupled with its love of miniature cans of lemonade, you will be thirsty.

"✅ Verified Review |  How the mighty have fallen, or should I say continue to fall. My partner and I booked tickets from London to Johannesburg back in September 16, we paid approx £1700 for the 2 economy tickets (slightly more than normal as we paid for extra leg room seats). It was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new A380, our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seats, so it was placed some 30 feet further down the aircraft - not life threatening, just annoying when you want to get things out of the bag, we were surprised about the lack of space. Our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced ""here is your vegetable lasagne"" rather than explaining that for our £1700 they were not able to offer us the default evening meal (chicken or beef) as they had ran out of these! They made no effort to remedy the situation, whether there were other choices in premium or business we will never know, all I can say is that I am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but wasn't happy with a vegetable lasagne so I had no meal as a result. As I left the aircraft I received a text from BA asking for feedback on the flight, I took the time to respond  explaining all the above but received no response. Whilst I was in Johannesburg I tried to contact/ call Johannesburg to complain but trying to contact and speak to anyone at BA is like trying to get an audience with Pope Francis! I eventually received an email response stating that my complaint didn't qualify for any redress, I then challenged this, I explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft 1) would I have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight (no!) and 2) would BA if they were reasonable, expect me to pay the full cost. In summary, I eventually was offered £15 credit off my next BA flight - totally unacceptable as I don't fly that often, even £15 shopping vouchers and an apology would have been sufficient, I felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and it's onboard service and the same for it's customer relations which arrogantly doesn't give a damn.

"✅ Verified Review |  Madrid to London. Fairly chaotic check in, largely down to the Iberia staff. Boarding was quick and friendly welcome from cabin crew. Seats are cramped and on a par with low cost standards, cabin was reasonably clean. Flight crew gave good information. Inflight the crew started the new food and drink sales, and this was where the chaos started. The time they were taking for each row they served was excruciating. I was seated 9 rows back and gave up waiting for a drink and dozed off.

"❎ Unverified |  London Heathrow to Philadelphia return. Very good experience both flights. Mature crew outbound with longer waits for drinks and meal service, very energetic younger crew on return, where everything happened quickly and efficiently. Both crews friendly and had control of the cabin, which made for a relaxed atmosphere. Food noticeably better than of late - I hope this will continue. On return my original onward flight cancelled due to fog, but rebooking had been done by the time I checked in in PHL and I had a text message also to that effect. Concorde Room fine both ways though it is starting to look a little frayed, but still acceptable even if the food and beverage staff do not always smile very much.

"✅ Verified Review |  The decline of British Airways. My review is primarily on BA Euro Traveller in economy. Up to two years ago one felt good when travelling BA. They were miles ahead of budget airlines. Yes they were a bit more expensive, but one enjoyed reasonable food and beverage, checked in cases of 20kg, all part of the service. Today BA provides no free food or beverage, and require extra payment for check in luggage. Today, within Europe, BA has absolutely no advantage opposite EasyJet, Norwegian, Monarch or even Ryanair. Why should anyone pay extra for BA, they have lost absolutely their unique selling points. Incidentally coming back from Malta to London Gatwick in BA in business class, there is nowhere to hang coats. Previously BA flight attendants always hung them in a cupboard. And now NO CUPBOARDS! Extra seats instead. The Decline and Fall of a once proud BA. In future BA will need to to meet or be cheaper than the budget airlines.

"✅ Verified Review |  I was returning home for my wedding on December 27, 2016, connecting to British Airways from London Heathrow to Abuja. The seat I had chosen was changed to a horrible seat near the toilet. I never got an explanation for this action. However, I wasn't very fussy about this as I was very excited to be getting married. Also, the flight was dirty, the food was terrible and took forever to get served in the first place. Our flight arrived at the Abuja airport and I was supposed to get on another flight in two hours to my final destination within Nigeria. I went to claim my luggage at the carousel, I waited for hours till all the luggage had gone through and I couldn't find my luggage which had my wedding items in it, including my wedding dress. As you can imagine I was devastated, I had to cancel my connecting flight to my final destination in order to sort out this issue. I spent the night at Abuja hoping that my luggage would come in with the flight arriving the next morning as only one BA flight arrives from Heathrow to Abuja each day. My luggage never arrived the next day. Myself and my husband had to spend a hideous amount of money purchasing emergency wedding items. The BA staff at the airport weren't helpful at all, they were all very rude and none of them could give us any reasonable information as to where my luggage was. My luggage finally arrived about 5 days after my wedding in a very bad shape. Up till this day, BA has refused to acknowledge my claims and they haven't refunded me for all the expenses in the course of flying with them.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. Having previously flown BA First Class on the Boeing 777 and A380, this trip on an ageing Boeing 747-400 from Heathrow Terminal 3 was disappointing. The sooner BA replace these aircraft, the better. I had a window seat which at least was not as cramped as the middle seats, which looked more like BA's dreadful Club World seats. The first disappointment came after pre-booking meals only to be told that due to the cabin crew strike which had ended the day before we were flying, we would get a Club World meal instead. Why? There are only 14 First Class seats and the caterers were not on strike so quite annoyed to be offered a few AVIOS as compensation! The IFE screen quality was poor and the movie selection not particularly good. The good thing was that we had 2 excellent ladies serving in our cabin. BA need to stop treating their premium passengers with contempt and wake up to the fact there is a lot of competition. Priority boarding is a joke; anybody with a Bronze Executive club card gets that so half the aircraft rush to the boarding gate. Priorities need re-assessing (and controlling).

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Chicago in First with British Airways. It was better than my last trip in Club World, but having recently come off the back of an extended trip around Asia (not with BA), one quickly realises how sub-par most of the BA experience has become. Airport service at Heathrow distinctly average and economy style. Onboard, some staff friendly, some surly and frankly lazy. Loos were not checked or cleaned throughout the flight. While I don't fly to dine, this was more like pub grub compared to top first class airlines, and cost saving is clearly evident. IFE was okay.

"✅ Verified Review |  San Francisco to Johannesburg via London. The two flights were as different as night and day. Both night flights so the idea was to get as much sleep as possible. SFO-LHR BA286 19th January was a full Business Class cabin but amazing service by mature flight attendants. Perfect mix of professionalism, friendliness and efficiency although the Boeing 747 had seen better days. They had the main meal service done and dusted within two hours allowing for plenty of sleep. LHR-JNB, BA055 on 20th January was an absolute disgrace. Great aircraft but let down by shambolic and rude in flight service. These attendants were much younger and besides looking sullen and miserable the main meal service took 4 hours - this on a night flight. Post take off drinks were served relatively quickly. There was then a massive gap between that and the meal order being taken. And a further huge gap between the meal service being started. All the while being delivered by the most miserable steward I've ever had the displeasure to encounter. Being a Gold card holder the CSM (who was a delight) came to give me her 'personal welcome' and I did feedback about my experience. She acknowledged that these new crews are 'inexperienced' and I said that's no excuse for rudeness. Why can BA not mix the old and new crew together if the newbies cannot get to grips with a basic efficient service? Later had the pleasure of flying JNB-CPT on Comair (a BA franchise in South Africa). What a great little airline. Again very young crew but an absolute delight. Overall I give the journey a 6/10 but my breakdown would be SFO-LHR 9/10, LHR-JNB 2/10, JNB-CPT 9/10.

My headphones did not work in the seat either. But apart from it being a somewhat OK ish journey the offering of food and drink was shocking. We can only choose food and drink from a Marks and Spencer's booklet, believe me the food is not up to M&S quality, they should never have put their good name behind this BA endeavour to cut costs. Whilst I accept that the system was only recently introduced and there are forced to be teething problems, the fact that we can only pay for purchases by credit card which had many clients scrambling through overhead lockers was shameful. What on earth are BA thinking about? British Airways are seriously letting themselves down badly. We felt like low budget airline customers although we had paid a high price for our tickets.

"✅ Verified Review |  Flew from Gatwick to Tampa Business class on 7th January. The experience can only be described as appalling. The business class lounge facilities were not available due to move to south terminal. We had to use the general lounge that any passenger prepared to pay £37.50 could use. This meant it was overcrowded and dirty (through no fault of the regular staff. They just could not keep up with the number of passengers). We could not get a seat anywhere and when we advised BA staff of this we were told to come back later and see if there were any seats free. The BA ground staff were completely overwhelmed by the number of business class passengers complaining and appeared at their wits end. The flight was mediocre to say the least. The food was average and the service satisfactory. Having paid £2000 for a ticket it is not unreasonable to expect a good service. We formally complained to British Airways via their customer services department and the response came back as they were moving to the south terminal and we needed to be understanding as things would get better in the future! We were not even offered a refund on the tea we bought in the main area of the terminal as we could not get into the lounge they had provided. This is not good customer service and we will not in future travel with British Airways, we will be travelling Virgin even if it means we have to get several connecting flights to our destination.

"✅ Verified Review |  Never again! Booked a round trip from to London from Paris return with British Airways in business as had a separate ticket from Paris to Johannesburg (with AF in business class) and Cape Town to Paris (with Qatar in business class). On the outbound flight no issues apart from the appalling lounge in London T5. Checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which I found strange being a business class passenger. The reason I chose the BA flight was that it was from the same airport (CDG) as where my flight from Cape Town via Doha arrived and after a long haul flight the last thing I wanted was to have any hassle with the connection to London. The plan was to get refreshed in the lounge, rest for few hours and get on the flight. Unfortunately, my plans were trashed when I arrived at the check in and was told that my flight had been cancelled and that I had been rebooked from Orly (which is an hour away). It didn't stop there, no transfer was provided and when asked how do I get there, the unfriendly reply was ""well, get a bus"". No indication of where. The woman simply turned away from me and started talking to a colleague. Tried to get some more information to which the reply was ""go online"". She gave me a paper which I thought would be a map to the bus but it turned out to be a sheet of guidelines on how to get compensation. Thought ok, at least something. The next shock, when I arrived in Orly. The check in lady told me that instead of business they had put me in economy! As I was very tired and just wanted to get home, agreed but asked if could still use the lounge. Oh no, not possible! At this point I was absolutely appalled and asked to speak to the manager. Was told that it was not possible and that I could go online and complain. Gave up and went through security to find out that the flight was delayed again. Spoke to the same lady who tried to ignore me and kept repeating ""go online, I don't care about BA"". When back home complained to customer services and got a reply that no compensation was due as they had ran out of staff to operate that flight. Complained again as had the paper from the CDG ground crew about compensation. Generic reply after 5 minutes was, no compensation.

"✅ Verified Review | In September 2016, I flew with British Airways in First from London to Kuala Lumpur on flight BA0033. Initial impressions were positive. The check-in was efficient with polite and friendly staff. The Concorde Room was a nice place to be. My First suite (2A) offered a good amount of comfort, space and privacy. Fast forward 12+ hours. Would I fly in British Airways First again? No. Would I fly with British Airways again? No. This is why: On the flight there were two members of cabin crew in the First cabin, with 8 passengers. The 1st cabin crew member was polite and professional. The 2nd cabin crew member was extremely unprofessional. The supplied headphone set was faulty and did not work. I had to ask twice for a replacement set. It took over 40 minutes to receive this. Once airborne, I ordered a cappuccino. I had to ask three times for this and wait over 50 minutes for it to arrive. There were multiple issues with my dinner: - I was the second person to order my dinner; yet the last person to be served. It took over 2 hours to get my dinner. Someone who had ordered after me, got my dinner option (I was told some 30 minutes after placing my order that only one option was available). It would appear that this passenger had a higher Executive Club membership and therefore was given my choice of main course. I was only given the option of a Club World main course (which was delayed further as I was initially given the wrong order). This delay in service had a detriment to my own sleeping plans and I was extremely disappointed at the service from the 2nd cabin crew member. There were issues with my breakfast: Despite being the first passenger to wake up and order my breakfast, another passenger was served first and given my breakfast. I ordered a Cappuccino; the 2nd cabin crew member ignored this order. When I enquired again (some 40 minutes after I had placed my order) I was told that the seat belt sign was now on and therefore I could not have this. I was extremely disappointed as at the material time I placed my order (and for some time after this) there had been no seat belt sign displayed. The First cabin toilet was not cleaned properly throughout the flight. Formal Complaint Within 24 hours of landing in KUL, I wrote a formal letter of complaint outlining the aforementioned issues and emailed this to the CEO of British Airways, Alex Cruz. The ‘You First’ department at British Airways confirmed receipt of my email. Subsequently, I received a very generic response from British Airways Customer Relations. No attempt was made to address (or even explore) the issues that gave rise to my complaint. This was disappointing. I was simply offered 10,000 Avios points. I responded by return, rejecting this offer and again asked for an explanation to why I had received such poor service during my flight and why no attempt had been made by British Airways to address the issues that I had outlined in my formal complaint. The response from British Airways Customer Relations was again disappointing and did not offer any explanation other than the matter would be dealt with internally and that the gesture of 10,000 Avios points was because British Airways “have to be consistent so we’re fair to all our customers”.

"✅ Verified Review |  St Petersburgh to London. I don’t know where BA got this market research to say stop complementary meals, we prefer to pay for it ! I’ve yet to find anyone who agrees with this idea and certainly no one asked me for my opinion. If you want to buy something different, you always have the option in the endless airport shops before boarding. I suggest they look seriously at their market research company if this is true, though I suspect the real reason is cost cutting, BA just doesn’t want to admit it. BA would be better off to admit it, customers would have more sympathy than trying to promote this policy as some benefit to the customer when clearly they are removing benefit and keeping price the same, we can all see through the attempted deception and it does the image no good. To tell me that charging £1.80 for water or soft drink is a bargain when I can buy the same thing in Tesco for 63p insults my intelligence, they are exploiting the fact that passengers cannot carry liquids through security so they have a captive market, again a great image to promote to the world.

However, if you wanted snacks (on a very long flight) you have to buy them on board, and with a long flight and meals only at the beginning and end people get hungry. You do not expect to have to buy snacks on such an expensive flight. There was also nowhere to plug in laptops, which you expect on a long and expensive flight-especially when you have work to do.

"✅ Verified Review |  Shanghai to Zurich via London return, and British Airways is absolutely appalling. I have never experienced such terrible customer service from an airline. I booked two return premium economy seats for my mother and I to go from Shanghai to Zurich via London. On the way there, the flight to Zurich was cancelled due to French strike, not BA's fault so that part is clear. However, they kept the flight on the board until very last minute then told everyone it was cancelled, furthermore, they ran out of hotels to put people up and we wasted about 5 hours (after a 12 hours flight) to go through customs (thank god we can enter visa free unlike a few other passengers), find a hotel, arrange our own transport there and back. So the first leg already left a terrible impression. Then, on the way back to Shanghai, they overbooked business so they pushed business passengers into premium economy and then pushed my elderly mother and I to economy for a 12 hour flight. I booked premium economy for a reason, my mum has health issues and need the room in premium economy, did BA care? No. Told us that we were involuntarily downgraded upon check in but that likely we will still get a seat, then at boarding, told us sorry it's either fly economy now or wait till tomorrow to see if there is a seat. Because I had work the next day, we had no option but to fly and BA ushered us on with the promise that they will put in the fare difference request on my behalf which will be processed asap. Three months down the track, I have yet to see a single cent of fare difference and of course there are no customer service phone numbers/emails to write to, only an impersonal link online for you to submit a reference and compliant to their customer service black hole.

"✅ Verified Review |  We travelled Business Class from Gatwick to Barbados return for Christmas 2016. The outbound flight plane had not been cleaned well at all - food crumbs around seat area, stained carpets, wet toilet floors etc. The cabin crew member was not aware of taking passenger coat procedure and suggested we ""hang it up wherever you can find space"" - we collected our own coats prior to landing. When the food was served we had been noted as 'not eating' - when the mistake was realised and the mistake initially made by the senior stewardess, the two hot options were unavailable - I had cheese and biscuits and my husband went without. The quality of the video/audio was very poor - the picture clarity poor and the sound distorted making certain films unwatchable. On the return flight the Executive Lounge was fully booked and we had to use the packed lounge in the main terminal.

"✅ Verified Review |  Well, I've checked in online hoping that it would actually speed things up when at the airport. Silly me. The queue was ridiculous for bag drop and I had to spend over 2 hours waiting to drop my bag! The queue for assisted check in was far quicker – I think that things got inverted now. Maybe quicker to check in at the airport? So I was hoping to have had time to eat before the flight. British Airways were completely under staffed and disorganised. There were no signs of people trying to indicate where we should go considering the massive queues. Total fail. I felt I was flying with a low cost airline. I kept checking the flight details for any planned delays - it was obvious that it was going to be massively delayed because of snow, etc, but the monitor and alerts were indicating departure at 10.22 instead of the planned departure at 10.00. Well, that was the case until 5 minutes before 10.22! Finally we got 'updated'. I doubt that this was only known at that time. Why wasn't there an update before? Anyway, new departure time scheduled for 11.59. We only started boarding at 11.00. Then, inside the cabin, we waited for another hour until taking off. At no point did BA offer vouchers. We only ate inside the cabin after 2am. The flight was terrible but that's another story. I see no point at flying with BA (for a few years now). Staff are old and 'entitled'. When you are not lucky enough to fly in a modern aircraft, you are presented with filthy dirty seats. Food getting worse and worse, and in board entertaining – almost non-existent.

"✅ Verified Review |  I paid almost £300 to fly from London to Frankfurt. The flight took off and then was re-routed back to London because of weather and German air space closing. The communication to passengers was horrible and it took two hours waiting in line to get a hotel room, only to learn they still hadn't rebooked my flight. While waiting in line, I tried multiple times to call their customer service number, and was on hold for twenty minutes at a time before hanging up due to international cell phone costs. The rebooked flight landed 22 hours after my original flight was supposed to land, and even that flight was delayed because of broken air conditioning. Which was identified after we already boarded and were sitting on the tarmac during a rare London heatwave. I landed almost a day later than planned, but my bag didn't make it from London for another four days. British Airways provided no guidance for which baggage and delay related expenses they'd reimburse, yet then denied portions of my claim.

"✅ Verified Review |  Flight from Athens to Heathrow delayed by 30 minutes which seems to be the ""norm"" for this flight with BA. However a few minutes before call to board an announcement came over that that no food nor drink would be available on this flight, no explanation as to the reason. Fortunately I was in the business lounge so grabbed a can of coke and a couple of rolls but for others they would have no time to purchase anything even if they are happy to pay airport prices. This was a 4 hour flight by the way. I had no idea that BA are now charging for food and drink even for water (they kept that one quiet). I rarely travel with hold luggage so now have to pay extra for the luxury of choosing a half decent seat (they kept that one quiet as well when this policy was introduced last spring). How long before they start charging for airport check in or duplicate documents the same as Ryanair. Will they be selling lottery tickets next? Pay-as-you go toilet? British Airways still refer to themselves as ""the worlds favourite airline"". Based on who`s opinion exactly? See no point in using BA now. They usually come out as one of the most expensive carriers when choosing a route. They have the most ignorant and unhelpful cabin staff out of any other carriers. I fly about 100 times annually through business and try and avoid BA. With this latest money grabbing scam I will change my scheduling to avoid them.

I'm not even bothered about the sandwich to be really honest but on a 4 hour flight I expect BA to give me a drink.

✅ Verified Review |  Houston to London Heathrow in Business Class. The service from the cabin crew was less attentive and organised than the outbound flight. British Airways used a Boeing 777 plane rather than the 747 used on the outward journey. This meant there was no upper deck seating. The seats are comfortable and convert to flat beds. Both journeys provided a welcome drink and 3 course menu. I found I was still hungry after the meal so made use of the snacks available at the bar.

This latest British Airways trip from London Heathrow to Dallas Fort Worth just confirms how standards are slipping. Background: family living in USA = regular leisure transatlantic flyer, in the last 10 years consistently booking for 2-3 travellers on each trip, regularly flying Business for eastbound transatlantic leg. To date transatlantic travel (over 30 years) has been exclusively with British Airways. Service has been almost consistently good or very good. We may not be Gold or Silver members, but we don't deserve the shoddy treatment this most recent booking received. 1) Original booking for outbound LHR-DFW leg was booked by BA agent over the phone in the wrong category/class, even though it was made clear we wished to purchase an upgrade (cash or airmiles) at a later date. Subsequent phone calls over the next few months were a farce, with consistently inconsistent responses - when we eventually managed to get through. The Executive Club customer service link just sends you round in circles! A formal emailed complaint through ""Contact us"" resulted in ""we're sorry to hear you've had problems"" - but no solution offered. Teeth gritted and traveled. 2) 9.5 hour flight LHR-DFW departing 1030. Refreshments/drinks served 1130ish before lunch. 9year old daughter hungry, no nibbles. When asked, steward responded ""well, that's cutbacks for you"". Pre-ordered child's meal arrived 1230, before standard adult meals. No problem. Juice and water were available during the afternoon. No snacks available for children for 5 hours! ""Cutbacks"". Luckily I had a packet of shortbread (as a gift for friends in USA). At 1830 cabin service (tea) started. When I asked for daughter's pre-ordered child's meal, conversation with stewardess went thus - ""Why didn't you order one?"" ""I did!"" ""She didn't have a child's meal at lunch"" ""Yes, she did!"" ""Oh well, I'll check when I've finished serving the main cabin"" Really? We were only in the 3rd or 4th row - would it have been too much effort to check then? Clearly yes it would. And when she did check some 20 minutes later, there was no child's meal - so they cobbled together a few bits from an unused child's lunch, very ungraciously. No hint of an apology. Customer service?

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Hong Kong return. Through no fault of our own, very late-running bus, major road accident, and a driver who threw us off in the cargo area and told us to wait for the next bus – my friend and I missed our 18.30 flight to Hong Kong on December 12th. We thought we would be re-booked on the later 20.50 flight, especially since we had business class tickets. Instead, we were told by the BA official at the misnamed ‘Customer Services’ desk that we had ‘voluntarily’ missed our plane (I assume that was code for ‘it’s your fault, not our problem’; that was certainly what his attitude conveyed). We were then offered 3 options – pay a supplement of £1478 to take the 20.50 flight, take a downgrade to Premium Economy WITHOUT a guarantee that BA would reimburse us the difference in seat price, or wait four days. The BA official couldn’t have been less flexible or sympathetic, and BA has responded to my complaint via Twitter with the same disinterest. My travel companion’s business class seat was a gift for her 60th birthday. Any pleasure she might have got from it, and mine in giving it to her, were ruined by the way we were treated. On the (half-empty) flight back on New Year’s Eve the crew obviously didn’t want to be there, was barely courteous, and when my friend, a diabetic, enquired what would be in her special meal, she was told no-one knew. They clearly didn’t care, either. They did very grudgingly eventually agree that she could order from the regular menu after making it clear that this was an exception and a ‘privilege’ she was being granted. I would have thought, and expected, a little more courtesy and grace, especially in Business Class. God knows how the poor souls in the back were treated. I have given my preference to BA for years in order to support my home airline. Sadly, I don’t think they deserve my custom any longer, so the next time we fly to Asia we will take one of the Gulf airlines who at least give the impression that they want and value your custom. BA’s only concern these days is profit at any price; their customer service is as poor as any I’ve ever come across, and their corporate motto ‘To Fly To Serve’ an embarrassing joke.

"✅ Verified Review |  Miami to London Business Class. Living in London, and flying international long haul flights throughout the year I have once again been disappointed by British Airways poor maintenance for premium amenities in preferred cabins. Our family of four were travelling home from the Christmas holidays on an overnight flight and when I was ready to sleep I attempted to recline my seat in the ""flat bed position"". My seat would not recline. The flight was completely full and there were no other seats available to switch me to. These are simple checks a maintenance crew could and should go through prior to boarding an aircraft. I notified the flight attendant to see if he had any knowledge as to how the seat could be adjusted in an attempt to fix it. Sadly, he did not.

Prior to landing (20 minutes before on a 9 hour flight), the purser spoke to me and apologised on behalf of BA and said he could compensate me with either £50 or 10,000 Avios. I informed him there was a far greater price point between Premium Economy vs. Business Class. Understandably, he apologised and said that was all he was capable of doing. I received a call from a BA representative and I was informed that she could only provide me with similar compensation - £50 or 10,000 Avios. (I currently have 588,500 avois on BA that is nearly impossible to use). I requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight from Heathrow to Atlanta from a Premium Economy seat to a Business Class seat.

"✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to London return in Club World on 787-900 with British Airways. Outbound was upgraded a couple of months ago from World Traveller Plus (worth the money for a decent night's sleep). Fast check in and fast track security at Pearson meant I was in the lounge within 15 mins. Excellent lounge supper service with a choice of a roast or noodles in soup. The lounge is well managed and maintained with friendly staff and a well stocked bar. On time boarding but a delayed departure due to loading baggage. A glass of champagne, with a top up, before departure. I always find boarding in Club World disjointed and fragmented as crew from World Traveler assist making the pre departure service erratic. A fast drinks service and supper were served with lights out. A well timed late breakfast meant a decent 5 hours sleep on this leg and my food choices were actually available. Priority bags beat me to the baggage belt. The return leg was enhanced due to being upgraded 24 hours before departure. (clearly oversold for such early action but welcome as a BA Silver member). The flight was one of my best business class flights and reminded me of the old BA I knew and loved. Fast bar service done by tray and not by cart, an excellent meal of roast chicken, with a delicious caramel desert (plated too) and some decent wines. The only reduction in service spotted this time was the wine list was down to two reds, two whites and no Rose. That said, the wines were very good. The cabin crew excelled throughout with the two crew professional, friendly and delivering excellent customer service promptly when asked. Afternoon tea is a now a bit of let down with the scones dropped. An early landing, and prompt bags on the belt completed a stellar trip back home.

"✅ Verified Review |  Having read so many negative reviews on this site regarding British Airways and their First Class product I was somewhat concerned as to what the experience would be like on our First Class flight from LHR-SAN on BA273 on their B747-400, I needn't have worried, this flight was excellent on all aspects. Our domestic connecting flight from MAN-LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to fog at LHR, the Captain  came into the Gate area and explained the reasons of the delay and invited questions from any concerned passengers about their connecting flights in LHR. Luckily we had planned 4 hours into our itinerary so the delay caused us no problems, passengers with tight connections at LHR were offered alternative connection options. The Concorde Lounge in LHR T5 BA First Class passengers was superb with professional and courteous staff, we had booked a Cabana and Spa Treatments, both were superb and highly recommended, plan time into your itinerary to enjoy these to the full. The lounge offers A la Carte Dining and the food was excellentpromptly, Champagne and great wines were also available. Onboard the BA747 in the First Cabin we had seats 2A & 2K, these offered great comfort for the 11 hour flight, the seats were made into a bed by the cabin crew when you requested it, I got 6 hours sleep, good quality quilts and pillows helped this. Seats 1A or 1K may have been slightly better for a couple travelling together as they are closer together than 2A 2K, but this is not a negative issue. The meal service was excellent, dine when you want, excellent choice of aperitifs, wines and champagne. The young Cabin Crew offered excellent attentive service in a very professional manner throughout the 11 hour flight. First Class seats offer good privacy, probably centre seats 4EF and 5EF offer the least privacy and therefore I would avoid these where possible.

"Flew London Gatwick to Tampa with British Airways. Gatwick is a modern airport, but check-in was slow as was security. In the departure hall plenty of places to eat and shop.

Once on board the aircraft we departed quickly.The seats was pretty old but just about comfortable enough. Once in the air immigration cards are handed out followed by a drink service, but no pretzels like BA used to do. About 2 hours after take off food was served. (chicken curry or vegetable lasagna). Lunch was quite nice, but small. After lunch duty free was sold. Four hours into the flight the cabin lights were turned off. The IFE was OK, there were lots of movies and tv shows, but not many games. Also the screen went fuzzy when the moving map was on. Screen was small but touch screen still worked. Between meals there were snacks available, but they had to be paid for (there used to be a free snack box). Drinks were also avaliable and free between meals. An hour before a sandwich, kitkat and a drink were served, the size was not adequate, but tasted nice. After the service was cleared plane stared the long descent into Tampa airport.

"Frankfurt to Cape Town via London Heathrow. The short haul legs were short and efficient and seat is standard for European business class. The salad was good, I didn't like the dessert. Heathrow to Cape Town on old Boeing 747-400, and even though this is still one of my favorite aircraft, the business class on was the old one. The seat itself was comfortable and I prefer to be shielded from other passengers, but no stowage space for small items around your seat, not possible to watch TV during take off. There is not much to watch anyway, and a dirty seat and cabin. No USB plug or at least an international plug but only a UK plug. How international. The full flat bed is good if you are shorter than 187cm. This is the only airline in business class long haul that has 6 seat in a row. The service was good, but needs some nicer touches though.

Flight delayed 4.5 hours due to mechanical problem. So for the insult of paying for reasonable seats, my wife and I were rebooked in the very last row of the aircraft - no refund, just shoulder shrugs about it being a different aircraft. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Venice, thereby incurring a 7 hour wait at Heathrow. Overall a loss of a half day. Thinking that BA would want to atone for royally jobbing us on the flights, was wasted. A couple of low cost vouchers for small meals were provided. A suggestion that access to the British Airways lounge would be a class way to assuage the delay was met with a look of astonishment.

"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Toronto via London, and I tried to check-in online. However, this was blocked and upon enquiry to BA’s unhelpful Customer Contact centre, I was told it was a “random” security hold by airport authorities. When I questioned that the supervisor changed the story to one of needing ETA for travel to Canada. When I informed her that could not be the case as I was a dual UK-Canadian citizen, she changed the story to one of it being ascribed to the company but that it could not be changed because of the website. Only after repeated complaints did she bother to take my Canadian passport details and lift the block previously described as out of BA’s control. The second joy I had with lovely BA and staff was at Heathrow during transit. As I had a 6-hour layover I elected not to go to transit and to meet my parents instead at T5 arrivals. Upon entering departures, I was stopped by one of BA senior managers who forced me to check in my carry-on luggage (despite it being cleared by BA in Dubai) but was more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on through. Perhaps she is the model random manager BA aspires to for future leadership. In any case, this “manager” was so eager to check by carry on in, that she left a whole bunch of company documentation with me at the check-in agents location. Such is the competency and class of this “manager” but then again one can expect no less from BA either. Finally, at Toronto, the checked in carry on came half-hour after the already delayed regular checked-in luggage – adding salt to wound. I flew to London from Dubai several times last year on Emirates, and on KLM/Delta/Air France to Toronto at multiple other times and never had any issues with security or carry-on from any of them.

The first flight, BA informed me at the airport I no longer had a ticket, as they had oversold the flight. They then explained I would have a free hotel stay, as if I had won a prize. I avoided them for months after that one. Then I slipped back into a bad habit and booked them again for a work trip to Ukraine. On the return trip, they asked me if I would like to cancel my connecting flight and rebook it for the next day, as my outbound plane was delayed. I said no thank you, as my BA connecting flight was delayed by the same amount. I arrived 90 minutes prior to take off for the connection (all in the same terminal), suddenly the boarding pass on my phone disappeared and was replaced with a ticket for 9.45am the following day. They ground staff explained they had cancelled my ticket as they thought I would not make it. Here I am is my reply. 'Sorry sir, the plane is now closed'. 'So you sold my ticket on'. 'No sir, but the plane is closed'. 'It cant be closed, there is plenty of time'. 'Yes, but there are no seats'. I debated the point. 'I wouldn't debate the point sir, a lot of people have been pushed off flights today, and hotels in London are being booked out, if I were you I would jump on the internet and find accommodation'. Because of course it was now my problem to find a hotel room in London (BA cover rooms up to £200, fine, though if you have kids they give you a mere £12.50 to cover breakfast, lunch and dinner for each child - in London, good luck). Get a hotel, arrive back at the airport the next day, wait in line for 2 hours (luckily I arrived 3 hours early for domestic flight), get to the check in desk. Guess what, I am booked on the flight but it appears my seat has been given away. Again, of course, its my problem. 'Go to the special management desk sir'. At that desk they tell me it could be today I get home, it could be tomorrow, but its hard to say, given the Xmas period. But all in super surly tone, and it was clear this was all my fault. 'You can try another airline sir but they are all booked out' (at this stage I began checking car rentals and ferry times). Absolutely disgusting attitude. Every other airline I have dealt with, in these type of situations, booked me a hotel, and had a bus waiting or a taxi, with a return boarding pass for the next day.

"Bangkok to Manchester via London. I used to fly BA on this route on a regular basis 10 years ago and was impressed with the whole offering. More recently we've been using Emirates or Etihad. We travel the route two or three times a year to visit family. BA were offering a good price on their Premium Economy seats so we switched. What a big mistake. Never, ever again. Despite paying a premium price you can only book your seat within 24 hours of departure unless you pay a £40 - £50 surcharge. Reluctant to pay we had some anxious moments worrying whether we would sit together. In the end it was OK but we can't get over the cheek of charging to book a seat - Emirates and Etihad don't charge. The seats themselves were very old and uncomfortable. Leg room was OK but the seats were very narrow. Nothing like the comfort of Emirates or Etihad in Economy. Inflight entertainment was on a post card size screen with a touch screen that was very inconsistent. Picture quality was like watching a TV in the 1950's. Food was appalling. Little choice, insipid starters and mains swimming in water. Other than an initial drinks run and obviously the food service the rest of cabin service was nil! If you want extra drinks or service including water the only recourse was to visit the galley at the back of the plane. Cabin crew were surly and generally unhelpful. The plane was old and the cabins were tired and threadbare in places.

"The return flight from St Lucia started well. To my surprise the Business Class lounge for 1st and Club customers at the airport was a pleasant shared lounge and the British Airways flight was the only one leaving at this hour. It was very nice - considerably better than the dive at Antigua. It was light and airy, very comfortable seats and some decent snacks and a well equipped bar. We enjoyed our stay there. It was some trek to the plane. As I entered the front forward door and made my way to seat 1A a lady FA almost grabbed me and snatched at my boarding pass - ""we have to see it,"" she said sharply, ""its a security process."" I was startled at the aggressive tone as if I was trying to sneak on the plane. Very strange as I had passed three boarding pass checks anyway. Pre flight drinks was the usual lukewarm champagne. Plane left on time to the minute. There were five empty seats in 1st. I found my miserable looking, ever thinning pillow (they get smaller with every flight to save money) and went looking to sneakily find another. Can you believe this! Five empty seats. Four empty overhead bins. One remaining pillow in the fifth bin! (Which I grabbed). Even with two - on lie flat I had hardly any head support. My wife asked for a 2nd pillow. ""Sorry madam we have none to spare."" Dinner started with Quinoa Salad and smoked trout. It was alright. Cream of broccoli soup likewise alright. Balsamic honey glazed chicken for mains was a disaster. Dried out. Unedible. FAs made up my bed. It was hard as rock and very uncomfortable. I slept not for one minute. Nor did my wife. Nor did the lady in the adjacent seat. I flew the A380 in 1st, last spring to Singapore and slept for 5 hours - but it was far more softer to sleep on. I can only surmise the seat, about five years old - was worn out. (The side areas were also very grubby). We both embarked totally shattered. The plane generally was very tired. Worn carpets that really should be replaced. The usual cheap amenities bag rounded off the usual poor experience with BA 1st Class. The IFE was very dated. One wonders if the BA board every think of flying with an Asian or Middle Eastern carrier to discover what true 1st Class should look like. FAs - apart from the rude one - were great.

"Appalling food, especially on the Orlando-Gatwick return leg. Choice of a horrible-smelling curry and a vegetarian pasta, the pasta was as if it had been boiled for an hour and the tomato sauce tasted like it came from a chemical factory. There was a roll but no butter, instead a tiny pot of 'spread' that was whipped up to give it bulk and which virtually disappeared in your mouth the moment it entered. For 'breakfast' we were given a tough bagel with a filling of cream cheese that was probably only a few molecules thick. No juice etc. The attitude of the flight attendant was completely disinterested and unhelpful when I asked her to ask the person in front of me to return her seat into the upright position when drinks were served. The amount of space that the reclined seat deprived me of would have made the drinking of my drink very uncomfortable.

"✅ Verified Review |  I have been a loyal BA frequent flyer for a decade but with their recent cutbacks this might well change. On my recent long haul flight to Nairobi from London, I was shocked to find that the usual tray of snacks available through the flight was no longer available for free - like some cut-rate budget short haul airline, you have to pay. However, unlike a budget airline, BA fares remain higher than most. I returned from Nairobi in premium economy - yet instead of getting something for the substantial extra fare I paid to be in premium, breakfast consisted of 1 muffin - literally 1 muffin only - no juice, no fruit, no nothing. It is a disgrace and disrespectful to customers who have, as I have always done, accepted the higher fares for better service. Even the flight attendants are embarrassed with the new bare bones regime. It is no fun for them to suddenly be charging for token treats which have always been free. Note that BA never cut fares when the price of oil halved, making the current cutbacks about pure avarice. Disrespecting and providing poor service to your loyal customers while charging a premium is not a winning formula. And I wouldn't blame your invariably brilliant flight attendants decamping elsewhere where they will be better treated. The final insult was the response I got when I tweeted my above complaints. I was told that extensive customer research showed customers wanted to be charged for previously free snacks and preferred getting 1 muffin instead of the usual breakfast - while paying the same fare.

"✅ Verified Review |  Seattle to London Heathrow. The British Airways Lounge at Seattle is very poor for starters, with old lounge seats which are stained and give the impression it's still the 1990's. Plane was half full as it was Thanksgiving Day so that made for a nice relaxed flight. No real complaints as the seats in business class are private and comfortable for sleeping although the meal quality left a little to be desired. Woke just over an hour before landing and was served a bowl of cereal. No juice, fruit etc. and had to ask for the main dish which the crew seemed reluctant to provide, and when they did was just handed to me, without anything else. Glad this ticket was on miles.

"Flight from LGW to St Lucia got off to a puzzling start at check in. No priority tags available and I had to ask for them. (I need not have bothered as the bags came off the plane last anyway). The BA 1st Class lounge was ""still closed"" pending refurbishment. (I do not think BA have any intention of re-opening the lounge at LGW.) The No ""1"" alternative is okay. Boarded and shown to seat. Noted floors had not been hoovered from the inbound flight. All scruffy. Flight took off on time to the minute. FAs throughout were fine - but no personal address by name. Seats look a little ""old"" - I suspect this plane was one of the first to have the ""new"" 1st Class. The IFE was certainly dated. Meal was ""sort of okay."" No ""Amuse Bouche"" anymore as BA want to cut further costs. Had to settle for some motley peanuts. They soon run out of the premium champagne - I suspect they only had two bottles on board. Crab appetizer was alright - nothing special. The usual butternut squash soup. This was my 5th 1st Class flight this year and my 5th identical soup. I suppose its too much to expect a nice clam chowder or lobster bisque from the bean counters at BA HQ. Main course of sole was dry and tasteless. Wines were fine and for once nicely chilled. Another disappointing experience from BA - but to be honest over time you get used to a ""business class"" product in BA 1st Class. I noted, when I selected my seats, that there was two unsold seats four days before the flight and a one way price was a staggering £4500. The flight was full - and if I paid £4500 for this - I would be in despair. I was asked recently why fly BA 1st Class at all. Its down to cubic meters of space. - and that's it.

"✅ Verified Review | British Airways crew going out from London Heathrow to Calgary were very keen and enthusiastic. They were also very good fun, which makes life more pleasant up in the sky. We do this flight every 6 months on our way to visit family in Canada. Food was good, but like other reviewers we've noticed little changes which make things not quite so special. For instance, the wine is not as pleasant as it used to be, and there used to be a choice of 2 types of red or white. One of our fellow passengers said he could have done with a bit more food. So take some snacks with you for the wee small hours. On the return journey, the dinner was good, but they ran out of beef in premium economy, and there were only 6 of us. We were given food from business, but it was served on a freezing cold plate, and just lacked finesse. I know this is only premium economy, but there were good standards a few years back. The breakfast before landing at Heathrow was horrible, a bagel, with some cream cheese in it and some tooth breaking cereal bars. I must write and complain to BA about their breakfasts, and have done so once, with no effect. I will try again. The staff were very efficient and we felt safe, and there were regular drinks runs, but like many others who travel regularly with BA, we were a little disappointed, and hope that they will be kind enough to listen to their loyal customers of many years.",4,2016-12-06, United Kingdom ,False,review british airway crew going london heathrow calgary keen enthusiastic also good fun make life pleasant sky flight every month way visit family canada food good like reviewer noticed little change make thing quite special instance wine pleasant used used choice type red white one fellow passenger said could done bit food take snack wee small hour return journey dinner good ran beef premium economy u given food business served freezing cold plate lacked finesse know premium economy good standard year back breakfast landing heathrow horrible bagel cream cheese tooth breaking cereal bar must write complain ba breakfast done effect try staff efficient felt safe regular drink run like many others travel regularly ba little disappointed hope kind enough listen loyal customer many year

On the return leg the crew were one of the most attentive and approachable I have met on a BA flight in quite some time.

"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Sydney in business class. The price was lowish so we booked—never again. Seat comfort was almost non-existent with appalling ergonomics. The in-flight service hit a new low for me: absolutely shambolic, no team effort, aloof hostesses were openly dismissive of passengers. Food and drink were cut-price and worsened by late wine and bread. No water offered and meal items forgotten. Entertainment choices were sub-par. No noise-cancelling headphones. No cosmetics in the dirty toilets. A dollar-shop amenity bag. I have had better economy experiences than this sector. Shame on you British Airways.

"✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong to London, seats 22K and 22J. It was one of the worst journeys we have ever had to entail. My other half who is 6'3"" was locked into a paralysed position for 13 hours made worse when the passenger in front reclined their seat for 90% of the flight. The small metal box in front of his seat also restricted his leg room and comfort. He couldn't even watch the in-flight entertainment as there was barely a gap between the screen and his face after the seat in front was reclined. As a shorter limbed person at 5'4"", I was also deeply uncomfortable through most of the flight. Placed in the middle, I barely had any where to put myself, seats were so narrow and confined and the person sitting on the other side of me was of slight build. My headphone socket was crackling and the film I wanted to watch, Cleopatra, (with the desperate hope of killing 4 hours of time) wasn't working, it was just a black screen with audio. After travelling long haul last year to Tokyo with another European airline, I could clearly detect a startling difference with the way economy passengers are treated on BA. Within 10 minutes of takeoff the other airline cabin crew handed out bottles of water and bags of pretzels to customers. On BA we had to wait at least 30 minutes before being offered a drink.

"Check-in at Singapore Airport is carried out in a separate area away from the desks and it was done quickly, efficiently and enables you to bypass the queue to enter the terminal. Boarding was chaotic. After announcing families with children, first and club passengers, and cardholders, the staff simply let everybody head towards the entrance. As before, the cabin crew were professional, helpful and enthusiastic. Dinner was served quite soon after takeoff because it was a late evening flight. It seems a shame that in its desire to cut costs, British Airways uses tablecloths and napkins which seem a little too thin and the cutlery is slightly too small. Nevertheless, the food was tasty and cooked properly and there was a good selection of wine and spirits. After a couple of glasses of port they made my bed and I slept soundly for several hours. The seat is equipped with two USB ports but these put out such little power by iPhone took a long time to charge and they could not handle an iPad. We landed at Heathrow on time and reached Terminal 5 within a matter of minutes. One of British Airways’ greatest assets is its cabin crew who, in my experience, are considerably better than their rivals.

Every BA flight I have taken this year has been a source of strife and disruption. From disruption in the cabin the like of which I have never witnessed on any airline other than British Airways, to delays on nearly all BA flights I have taken in 2016, rude, surly staff that act like BA was still a 1970's state enterprise.

"✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to San Francisco with British Airways. BA was once a classy airline for their first class service, amenities and food. But they have succumbed to the economic pressures to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to but the price is still absurd even using points. They even hijack you for an additional $1000. Or as I like to say, you cough up 200K in points and the $1000 fee covers their real expense for you to sit in first. They have jammed more seats in so the attendants have more customers. The seat in spite of its new design is tighter and less comfortable for a 6'1"", 240 person to do anything but sit up and watch a movie or hope they do not run out of the food selection on the menu. Second, the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times I flew BA in first I had young attendants who clearly were not use to serving FC customers. A request for say an additional pillow or second cup of coffee went unanswered more than once which is a sign of inexperience. The last trip flying home in April I was handed a menu with a tasting menu or a traditional menu. First class was maybe 50% full. When it was my turn, I asked the flight attendant if I could select some of the tasting menu along with features from the traditional menu - she said she would check and shortly returned to say they were out of the tasting menu items. Now please explain to me how any international first class service could be out of food 10 minutes after leaving the airport? Clearly if they do not have enough for mix or matching then this is a stingy sign of cutbacks on the lowest scale to save a few pennies. At the average price of $10,000 for a first class seat, BA should make damn sure first class has all the food you need. Their menu also talks about late night snacks and on the last two BA first class flights to the US when I wanted to try these snacks they were gone as they are shared with business class. The food served is both uninspiring and generally on the level of US airlines first class which is cooked to death and reheated. Way to go BA, you have sunk to the lowest common denominator. Third, when I arrive in SF and in spite of my luggage having a priority tag, it never comes out in the first batch and often towards the end of the delivery so they have failed on even that count. Unlike the first class asian carriers like Singapore and Cathay where my FC luggage arrives first, BA is always hit and mostly miss. Finally, what galls me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my FC experience on BA. I let them know everything I said in this review and the last question asked is ""would you like us to call you regarding this review and experience""? Yes, I say and not once has someone called.

"London Heathrow to Toronto with British Airways. After experiencing the modern T5, we boarded our flight on time and got sat down. We were in an older 777-200, so the seats weren't very comfortable due to the material and the entertainment screen was small. We departed late as they had to unload bags, they also had to reset the entertainment system. In the air we were offered beverages. Later in the flight, the meal service. There was chicken curry (I had it - it was nice but the rice was a bit dry) and a pink-looking coleslaw as a side salad. The dessert was a butterscotch/chocolate mousse, which was good. The other alternative was a pasta. I watched some films - there was a good range - and I like how the BBC News is up to date so I could catch up with the current affairs. The crew were not overly friendly, but kept servicing us with extra drinks. I had a nap, and then we were served a small landing snack. The much rumoured Mars Bar is actually true, as well as some Belgian chocolate cookies and other small snacks.

"✅ Verified Review |  First leg DUS to LHR was Club Europe. While business class has no different seating to economy this aircraft was really a joke. It was completely outdated and worst of all it seems to be not cleaned before the flight. Crumbs on the seat. Table was sticky. Asking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaning. Overall crew on this flight was extremly friendly. Next leg from LHR to BOS very similar experience: Business class was upgraded with an outstanding new IFE but seats are still old. The housing of my seat was taped with gaffa tape next to the footstool. Asking crew about that they told me that the housing fell off and engineering was not able to fix it so they used gaffa tape. In general the 747-400 looks quite a bit dated and might need a further upgrade rather than the IFE and some smaller details (e.g. carpet should be replaced - extremely dirty and roved). Lounge in LHR very outdated. Boarding in LHR was somewhat uncoordinated as a lot of people don't listen to the announcements and try to board and impede boarding of other persons. Crew on board once again very friendly and effective. Meal choice was ok. But my impression is that quality is going down, e.g. beef was very fibrous and vegetable was somewhat overcooked. Club Kitchen -> long time an outstanding feature of BA is a joke nowadays. Selection seems to go down every time I fly. Worst of all: One of my bags did not made it to the aircraft. This itself can happen and is not a problem at all but the handling of this was a real joke. After identifying that my bag seems to be lost I went to the counter (even if finding it is not that easy in Boston). I explained my problem and the lady looked in the computer and said that I did not checked another bag -> although I had my tag that I could show to her. I had to discuss with her for several minutes and had to ask for the manager on duty in order to get a baggage claim written. Manager on duty was very unfriendly and except for writing the claim he did not provided any additional help. No apologies for inconvience at all. Last year I had one bag that was delayed. This handling was done by another person and was completely different experience. Extremely helpful and really sorry about the inconvience. Summarizing: Flying BA for business for many years and on a regular basis now. The changes under the new boss can be seen. While in the past British Airways was really good it seems to decline from month to month. This time flight was one of the worst I ever had with BA. I assume that if there is no change in the near term I will choose another airline in future e.g. a low cost carrier as there is not that much difference any more. If you read a lot of the other reviews you will see that I am not the only one thinking like this. I can't any longer recommend BA as especially the value for money is no longer given.

The food was to a high standard and my wine glass was kept topped up.

"✅ Verified Review |  Marrakech to London Gatwick with British Airways. Baggage allowance is a joke. Doesn't matter how much it weighs as long as bags are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by the airport staff. Apparently you are entitled to have one case and one piece of hand luggage to carry onto the plane. However, on boarding the plane there were people that had 3, or even 4 items of luggage which were far larger than ours. These items were crammed into the overhead compartments whilst other flyers had to remove their smaller bags and put them by their feet causing an even more cramped uncomfortable space to travel in. Other flyers had their duty free items smashed and broken. When we complained to the cabin crew they were in agreement and there was even a manager on the flight who witnessed this and gave us his business card to use as a reference when making our complaint the customers services team as he was also shocked by what was going on.

"✅ Verified Review |  I booked and bought an online ticket for a multi destination 6 week trip that took me from Bangkok to London, Angola, London, Nigeria, London and back to Bangkok. Before purchase I called the British Airways service number on website and asked if I needed to change rearrange dates with this ticket was that OK - was told 'yes but have to pay a £150 fee', and nothing else a little steep but OK. I further checked extra's would be against the Visa card used to purchase the ticket, 'of course' was the reply. BA make you pay to book a specific seat now. The trip started okay but the aircraft used on the Bangkok flight very worn and old - anyway got through to 3rd leg visiting Nigeria for 12 days business and looked like I could arrange to come home earlier - fired up the BA app on internet roaming service to find its not possible to re-book on the APP as indicated - not given any local number to call - search out possible BA numbers - to find they no longer have an office in Nigeria and get onto what transpires to be their call centre in India. Operator checks there is space on an earlier flight but then announces he has to check the additional cost to come up with an extra of £1000+. I decline this option and explain the £150 as advised (actually APP says change cost is £0). Later BA call centre call back and say they can offer a reduced cost - hustling for business like they are haggling in an open market - however for this option it would not be possible to take payment by Visa. It had to be paid in cash to only a single bank branch in Abuja (during bank open hours) - some 6 hours and 300Km's away. By now I had readjusted to fly on the original dates fuming with BA over the mis sold flight and ridiculous impractical conditions they try and enforce. Taking this up with BA complaints - takes 2 month to elicit a first response - to be dealt with on one sided website. They do not take responsibility for the advice given over the phone, will not acknowledge any shortcomings of their APP refusing to discuss it and failure to advise on their very special conditions that apply to their Nigerian flights.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Antigua. Having flown premium economy with other airlines we decided to upgrade our cabin for our holiday in Antigua at a cost of £350 to British Airways World Traveller Plus, and we were told by the sales adviser that we would receive a bigger seat pitch more personal service with dedicated staff for this cabin grade, better choice of meals and beverages. What we received was a polarisation of this - we had very poor service and the only difference between economy and our cabin grade was a slightly bigger seat pitch. Having flown long haul with BA on numerous occasions in the past I am completely shocked at the service we received - it was more like a budget airline - we received a half class of bubbly prior to take off, this was quickly followed with a drink service (one drink per passenger), we then received our meal service. I asked for white wine which was warm not chilled and there was no ice - about 50 minutes later they served lukewarm coffee. This is not the type of service I expect on any flight let alone in the upgraded World Traveller Plus cabin. After several hours when no other drinks service was offered I went to the galley to ask for a drink for myself and my fiancé, to be told there were no drinks left apart from whisky or red wine - which neither one of us drink. As the flight wasn't full I cant believe there would be a problem you just don't expect to hear this given the cost of the holiday and the upgrade that you have can only have 2 drinks on an 8 hour plus flight? 5 hours after the dinner service we were given a sandwich and that was the conclusion of the service aboard a flight of more than eight hours - certainly not what I would expect from an airline such as BA. Our return flight was in economy and the only difference was a slightly smaller seat pitch but as this flight again wasn't full we ended up with 3 seats between 2 of us. The service was exactly the same as on the outboard flight ie. same poor standard and for the first time ever there was no hot breakfast before landing we were served a brick hard croissant. I was looking to book a long haul holiday to the Maldives next year with BA but after this flight and the appalling customer service I received when I complained about the service on the flight when I was told that when you pay for an upgrade your paying for a bigger TV screen and bigger seat - which I certainly don't think that justifies £350 upgrade fee. If you are thinking of upgrading I would think twice about what you are paying for. BA have now lost my custom and having spoken to other people on holiday I am not alone in making this decision and therefore I have booked my holiday next year with Virgin Atlantic. BA can no longer rely on there previous good name they are cutting too many corners giving poor service and not interested in listening to their customer they need to decide if they are going down the budget airline route. If that is the case, they need to drastically cut the prices or start to give a more professional service and raise the standards where customers feel they are getting a good service for the price they have paid.

"Montreal to London and return to Toronto. O/W leg from Montreal was the most average club experience to date. Poor third party lounge with little food choice, disappointing wines and little ambience. Boeing 787-800 aircraft was substituted by Boeing 787-900 which was good on the face of it, except the same seat number moved me from the last row of biz to the one in front of the toilets - annoying as gate staff unable to move me. With the air bridge withdrawn, the plane went tech due to a power issue. Two hours later after a total reboot of the aircraft systems we took off. Excellent updates from captain. However, cabin crew were absent during the delay with Biz passengers including me having to ask for a glass of water. Bizarrely First was blocked off with lights off and vigorously enforced with no access to the front bathroom. Drinks and dinner served promptly. My choice of fruit for breakfast had already run out. Only 4 loaded for the whole of biz with honey and yogurt offered which turned out to be a 99 cent pot plonked on a plate. No croissant offered (left in oven in error) and the orange juice has been downgraded to UHT out of a carton. On the return leg from Heathrow T5, the club lounge was very disappointing. Shabby condition, poor food and drink service by the third party provider, with dirty / scruffy toilets which I had to queue for. Worst lounge experience to date and cannot be called first class by any means. Prompt boarding on a 777-200 with the first entrance blocked off. The cabin manager was by herself and so we were pointed towards first class.  Friendly crew, prompt champagne and a prompt drinks service after take off. recovered things a tad. IFE had not changed since my flights in October which was disappointing. The amenities bag in first is now the old club world offering. Average menu with the usual suspects of Beef, Chicken and Cod but were cooked and presented really well. The promised cheese plate had already run out - only 4 loaded. (seeing a theme here) and so cheese was fetched from club. Afternoon tea sandwiches were dry and bland. In the race to the bottom, BA continue to cut service - especially on the food front. I don't find it acceptable in first class for something as simple as cheese to run out with club food being substituted. This may save money (and wasted food) but the crew whilst cheerfully making the best of a bad job are not being given the food or or product to deliver first class service.

"✅ Verified Review |  Barcelona to London. Has anyone ever been told to bring marriage certificate while traveling abroad to Spain? According to a British Airways gate agent at Barcelona Airport, I supposed to have my marriage certificate with me in order to get on the airplane and leave Spain. I drove across the border from the States to meet a friend in Canada and flew out from Vancouver on the same day to London for a week, and then from London to Spain for two weeks. All along the way of going through customs of Canada, UK, and Spain, I was granted entries without been questioned till the last day of my vacation when I was leaving Spain. All of a sudden, this gate agent asked me “where are you going?  Where do you live?  Are you traveling alone?” I thought she was rather friendly until she pulled me aside from the gate and tell me “you have to wait here, I need to talk to someone.” There were at least over 50 people behind me waiting and trying to figure out why I cannot get on the airplane.  I am a permanent resident of US; however, I am a citizen of the country participates in Visa Waver Program, which means I don’t need visa to enter Spain and definitely not when I leave. So, what’s wrong!? My name on the boarding pass and passport are matching but the name on my US Permanent Resident Card does not match with my passport. Of course, I just got married so that I have different last name from my passport, but even that, what kind of right does she have to ask me for my US Permanent Resident Card and stop me at the gate like that?! So, when she asked me if I have any documentation to clarify the mismatch of my last name, I jokingly answered “marriage certificate??” Next thing I know was I cannot get on the airplane because I didn’t have marriage certificate with me, and what made it even funnier was after she spoke to someone, she said to me ""you can go this time but next time you will have to have marriage certificate with you.""

"✅ Verified Review |  Recently flew a return trip with BA to Miami onboard one of their A380 aircraft, and what has happened to this airline! Outbound flight delayed 1 hour once we had boarded due to a broken seatbelt which should have been spotted during turnaround. Having flown the route several times on the 747 we were looking forward to trying the A380. We were seated in row 31 which is the last row in the mid section just before the central galley area. From the moment we sat down there was a dreadful whine coming from the wall behind us! Upon asking the crew if this would stop they said they it was the fridges in the galley and once the engines started we wouldn't hear it. This went on for 9 hours and the crew issued us ear plugs to wear and said that the noise was ""normal"" on all their A380 aircraft. The food was horrid and only a choice of 2 meals. I chose a curry which had no flavour and was incredibly greasy. The return flight was a different A380 which had the same awful noise but it did stop around 2 hours prior to arrival. The food on the return was as disgusting as on the outbound leg and as for the ""breakfast"" it consisted of a cold bagel type thing with one blob of cream cheese in the middle. The standards have dropped so far it is incredible. I'm certain if I sat in row 31 on Emirates or the like I wouldn't be issued with ear plugs.

"✅ Verified Review |  The flight started in the First Class Concorde lounge at T5. It is certainly showing signs of wear with tacky material hanging down around some of the seats. The seat cushions need refilling. The general ambiance is quite good. A refurbishment is long overdue. The food quality and choice is generally quite poor - although the Crab Tortellini was good. Nobody invited us to choose from the menu or to offer drinks. I had to walk the floor and find someone. All sloppy. The menus also were worn and scruffy and someone, a child I think, had scribbled on the inside, some funny cartoons. We boarded and the flight departed to the minute. All good. The Boeing 787 has a small 1st Class and I realized that the space also is smaller than the 777 option. The 747 alternative is a total disaster and I go to great lengths to avoiding flying their 747s. Food was OK. Very little wow factor. The meze was fine. They ran out of Cod - and at this point I don't think we had hit the cruise. Seven from eight passenger - and only one Cod apparently. I had the lamb which was alright but on short night flights I prefer not to have meat. My wife's allocated seat was - broken, hence the vacant seat on the flight. So she sat one side of the plane and I sat the other. Brilliant. The plane was only six months old. Given the competition on this route you would think BA would want to impress. Was it a coincidence I wonder that there was no Arabic or Asian passengers on the flight? With Emirates on this route - why would there be? We landed on time and then had to walk miles.

"✅ Verified Review |  The flight started badly in the so called new Concorde lounge at Dubai. I have reviewed this in the lounge section. The situation was worsened by a three hour delay to our departure. Apparently minimum rest period had been compromised. Not sure if this was true but we ended up with a 787 crew not a 777 crew. On the 777 the First seating is double that of a 787 and result was we were served, the entire full cabin of 17 - by one FA. He did his best but must have walked about 10 miles in the flight trying to keep us happy. The Boeing 777 first seat is the largest of the three options (747/787/747). Mine was starting to show signs of wear. No amuse bouche. As announced last month BA have cut back this cost. Wow, a £3 saving on a £3,00o one way ticket. Well done BA. Champagne was lukewarm, as is often the case. Lamb and fennel salad appetizer was ghastly. Horrible in fact. The soup was the usual Butternut squash soup (do they offer anything else or am I unlucky) and was lukewarm but okay. The apricot chicken was pleasant enough but I could not taste any apricot. A bistro product at best. Later in the flight I had afternoon tea - sandwiches. All dry and tasteless. Watched a movie on the inflight entertainment system and this was fine. Nodded off and had two hour nap which was nice. Landed without being stacked for a change.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Mauritius return. Our outbound flight had certainly not been memorable, but new to British Airways we were prepared to wait and see. The inbound flight commented upon here was much worse, but with many facets of the earlier experience.  We paid two supplements for the flights. A substantial fee to upgrade from Economy and a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients - on overnight flights - we could sit together! The combined cost therefore was significant. The benefits were not. Firstly, upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood. A lady ahead of us had a headrest problem, she was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated.  Throughout the flight during waking hours, passengers seemed to be a nuisance. Food - as we had flown this class on other scheduled airlines, we were expecting a menu to select meals. How silly. Here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice - chicken or veg (a bright green Risotto). So, no Choice! No bread roll, no cheese and bikkies, a 'choice' of one red wine, and plastic cutlery. This was served after the attention in Economy, and may account for the absence of choice. Whatever, it was awful. It was noticeable how many meals remained uneaten. What a waste of resources. Significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter duration. The Premium Economy (WTPlus) cabin had no provision for toilets. It was necessary to go forward to Club, or back to Economy! It became clear early-on that going forward was not popular with those in that cabin, so back it was! During the night, with passenger debris in aisles, this was hazardous with shiny plastic bags (from headphone containers) to slip on. Is nobody in British Airways capable of seeing the provision of a loo for 24 passengers is essential?

"It does seem that many of the negative reviews of British Airways come from passengers travelling First or Business class. My wife and I flew from Heathrow to Los Angeles and found the entire experience extremely good. Boarding was efficient, the seats were comfortable and the leg room more than adequate. IFE was very good. The food was, well, it was airline food and you cannot expect haute cuisine at 38,000 ft. It was tasty enough, and there was some decent red wine.

"✅ Verified Review |  We'd booked to fly Club World 4 months ago. Turned up at St Lucia to be told British Airways had overbooked and we had been downgraded : this is on a £1700 ticket. According to the duty manager, they regularly oversell the premium cabins and staff are fed up with apologising to angry passengers. We were given £300 each travel vouchers as compensation, so it means we have to use British Airways again. We ended up in World Traveller plus (premium economy).

Our flight from London to Boston was okay. Disappointed to only be able to sit in middle of row of 10. Annoying to have to pay extra to have a window seat. Also catering on board is disappointing with only one meal plus a biscuit but crew were friendly and helpful. The return flight was different. Staff not particularly helpful. Person in front reclined seat fully and I wasn't able to fit food tray in. Crew member said I was causing problems for the man in front when I requested he put his seat up to eat. Also armrests did not lift up leaving less than 6 inches between seat in front and armrest meaning I was literally trapped in my seat for 6 hours. Not comfortable and unsafe in an emergency.

"London to Seville via Madrid. If you want budget airline service but decent airline prices, look no further than British Airways. I used to fly a lot with BA for both business and pleasure. But lately they really started dropping the ball. In 2016 I had a streak of 8 consecutive flights all delayed by 30 min to more than 2 hours. But that is not the worst. Recently I booked a flight to Seville from London. After a few weeks this flight got cancelled. It took me 3 different operators to find a solution via Madrid on the same day. ('No I don't want to fly the next day!). But guess what, 1 month later my outbound to Madrid got cancelled as well. Again it took some time to find an alternative. Ultimately I had to settle for a 7 hour travel time instead of 2.5 hours. Also I need to take extra holiday and additional costs to get to my destination in Seville. After complaining to BA about this process, I expected to get some sort of compensation, after all I'm an esteemed Silver member (their words). But none of that. A few phone calls later I am stuck with an automated e-mail service replying to me that no compensation is possible. I didn't ask for any money or anything. All I asked for is to waive the re-booking fee if I ever have to change a flight. This seemed only fair after BA cancels flights willy-nilly and doesn't take the customer into account. If this is the service extended to a Silver member, then I really don't want to know what they do to customers not part of their frequent flyer scheme.",3,2016-11-04, United Kingdom ,False,london seville via madrid want budget airline service decent airline price look british airway used fly lot ba business pleasure lately really started dropping ball streak consecutive flight delayed min hour worst recently booked flight seville london week flight got cancelled took different operator find solution via madrid day want fly next day guess month later outbound madrid got cancelled well took time find alternative ultimately settle hour travel time instead hour also need take extra holiday additional cost get destination seville complaining ba process expected get sort compensation esteemed silver member word none phone call later stuck automated e mail service replying compensation possible ask money anything asked waive booking fee ever change flight seemed fair ba cancel flight willy nilly take customer account service extended silver member really want know customer part frequent flyer scheme
"British Airways state that you can check in for free. When I checked availability 24 hours prior to the flight, there were only three seats available for the three of us. I also like to have a window seat however only available seats were aisle seats in C or J. Due to online check in, I had only the option to select an aisle seat. At T5 at LHR I spoke to BA customer services who advised that depending on how much you pay for the seat, only certain seats will appear available - in short, the less you pay, you get only the less popular seats with some not being available. This is apparently a new policy and the staff member said it has led to many complaints from customers. The aircraft was a 747-400 reg G-CIVV built in 1998. The aircraft had been renovated a couple of years ago and had new seats and LED lighting. However the aircraft tables were not clean, leg room was poor and the 747 is ""an embarrassment"". These are the words of a cabin crew member, not me. True - the 747 is an embarrassment when compared to the new airliners. Cabin crew were very friendly however were not widely seen, only towards the start of the flight. Food was ok - veg lasagne and a nice choc mousse. However only one meal followed towards the end of the flight by a fun size chocolate bar and undrinkable coffee.

"London Heathrow to Bucharest with British Airways. To fly to disappoint. After my arrival in Heathrow T5 the check-in area for Club Europe was clearly marked and separated for the rest of the check-in lounge and a host was guiding you to the check-in line. After saying hello to the host making my way to the check-in line I was stop with an unpleasant “Excuse me, this is business class”. Like a naughty school boy I returned to the lady and show her my boarding pass which allowed me to access the “exclusive area”. Check-in was smooth and I was airside in under 20 minutes. Enough time for some duty-free shopping in an airport already decorated for Christmas. Being a little bit hungry I was looking for the “light meals or snacks especially prepared for you” and “drink from our World Wine bar” as BA promised again on their website. The only  I made was some sad sandwiches and after checking 4 empty bottles on display I found some warm French white wine. Therefore, I decided to cut my time spent in the “comfortable private lounge” and treat myself with some Costa coffee and some nice tasty sushi in the terminal. Waiting for the promised menu which “features irresistible meal options crafted to perfectly match the time and duration of your flight”. Couple months ago a tasty plate with canapés was offered to passengers in Club Europe. In the London-Bucharest flight I was offered the eternal option “beef or fish” with, indeed, a nice polite smile from the Purser. The tray looked like an Economy tray on a Tarom or KLM flight to Bucharest. No salad, an overlapping end-of meal option of cheese and lemon merengue and a fish which was the blandest food I ever had onboard. When I was still looking for my “very British experience” the tray was taken away. Coffee and a second round of drinks were served shortly after the main meal service was finished. I couldn’t stop wondering where that smooth, stylish service from my last flight went. Of course, the crew was polite and nice as much as they can, shaping their enthusiasm according the product offered to passengers. And another odd element: no other drink service; you needed to ask for another drink as the crew was busy to stop the Club Europe toilet in the front from leaking and flooding the entire front galley.",3,2016-11-03, United Kingdom ,False,london heathrow bucharest british airway fly disappoint arrival heathrow check area club europe clearly marked separated rest check lounge host guiding check line saying hello host making way check line stop unpleasant excuse business class like naughty school boy returned lady show boarding pas allowed access exclusive area check smooth airside minute enough time duty free shopping airport already decorated christmas little bit hungry looking light meal snack especially prepared drink world wine bar ba promised website made sad sandwich checking empty bottle display found warm french white wine therefore decided cut time spent comfortable private lounge treat costa coffee nice tasty sushi terminal waiting promised menu feature irresistible meal option crafted perfectly match time duration flight couple month ago tasty plate canap offered passenger club europe london bucharest flight offered eternal option beef fish indeed nice polite smile purser tray looked like economy tray tarom klm flight bucharest salad overlapping end meal option cheese lemon merengue fish blandest food ever onboard still looking british experience tray taken away coffee second round drink served shortly main meal service finished stop wondering smooth stylish service last flight went course crew polite nice much shaping enthusiasm according product offered passenger another odd element drink service needed ask another drink crew busy stop club europe toilet front leaking flooding entire front galley
✅ Verified Review |  I have traveled with British Airways many times in the past. It is reliable and safe but the attitude of the cabin staff put me off.

Plenty of seating available although sadly I was too early for the dinner service so ploughed my way through the rather poor ""afternoon tea"" sandwiches. Wine selections however were tip top. Boarding at remote C65 quickly turned into a scrum, with passengers crowding around the entry gates preventing passengers invited to board from doing so.

"I was very disappointed to find that British Airways are now a very 'middle of the road' airline compared to a decade ago. Why? Firstly, compared to my only other flight in an A380 (Qatar Airways) there are more seats crammed into the BA business. On the outbound flight, only 1 of the 2 upper deck toilets was working and on the return flight my in-flight entertainment screen was broken which meant that it was not visible and kept springing back to a near closed position. The only possible solution the steward could find (as there was a critical bolt missing) was to wedge it with a cork which sounds very 'Flintstones' for a 21st century airline and whenever we hit slight turbulence the cork kept popping out and removing the screen from view (very annoying when you are half way through a film). The flat bed and window cabin storage was good but the beef that was my chosen main course was tough, tasteless and quite inedible. I gave up after 10 minutes of trying to cut it and chew it. They did at least have a nice bordeaux red wine. The staff did well enough.

The seat was comfortable with ample legroom, the food was excellent for airline food and both ground staff and flight crew were friendly and efficient.

The only downside was that the inflight entertainment stopped working after one hour, despite the crews efforts it could not be restored for the remainder of the flight. We did note one steward enter the premium economy cabin with a list and upgraded about 15 people into business, the rest of us went without for 8 hours.

The cabin crew even managed to find the last miniature of single-malt scotch for me (good job, guys).

Again, the service was on time, the cabin crew efficient, the flight smooth, and the bags came out at Edinburgh with no hassle. The return flight was equally good: prompt departure from Edinburgh, easy transfer at Heathrow, and on-time departure to Kuwait. This time, an un-refurbished 747, with the small seat-back screen, so I did not bother using the entertainment system. The evening meal was the dreaded ""chicken or pasta"" (come on, BA, can't we have a change) but edible and tasty, and the cabin crew were professional and unobtrusive, passing through the cabin regularly with juice and water on this overnight flight.

"✅ Verified Review |  I am tall, 196cm to be exact. That's why on a recent flight from London to Brussels I couldn't face being crammed into a microscopic economy seat. Instead I decided to pay £385 to fly in British Airways ""Business"" class. What a mistake! On arrival to Heathrow's Terminal 5 I tried to enter the queue at zone B as directed by one of the information signs. I was told that the staff had decided to close that so I had to go somewhere else. I joined the queue at ""C"" instead but was told when I got to the front that business class checked in at H. I made my way to British Airways business class lounge, which was crowded, dirty with wet smelly bathrooms that looked more like a run-down bus station than an airline's lounge. The place was wildly understaffed which meant that there were used plates, cutlery and half eaten food littering tables in the room. It was far less crowed in the rest of the terminal which is where I waited for my flight. The gate was announced and I made my way to gate 10C where the flight was being bussed. I was in seat 3D. It was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroom. The whole point of spending £385 was legroom and I didn't have any. I asked the flight attendant if anything could be done.  BA would not have been my choice anyway but I do understand that given tight schedules and limited choice sometime you are forced to fly with a particular company against your better judgment.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick - Pisa Return. Another less than satisfactory experience with British Airways. I fly this route often as I have a home in Tuscany. When I first flew this route (as opposed to Ryanair) on arrival you had an air bridge which made it a more satisfactory experience. Now, as a cost cutting exercise - you don't. Which means if its raining you get wet. which we did. The BA LGW Club lounge is closed and we went to a temporary set up at the North terminal. It was fine. Very busy - but the light lunch was better than BA's own set up - the last time we used it. Plane left 40 minutes late as we were stuck on the apron waiting for a slot. I settled for a couple of G&Ts - and my wife had the afternoon tea which she said was fine. On the return the ""Club Europe"" lines at Pisa check in were used by just about anyone. It was a zoo. The BA airport crew didn't care and given the management at BA don't care about customer service and quality, why should they? Lunch was quite pleasant, some sort of Chicken dish. We got stacked for 15 minutes which is annoying. On both flights I got the front row which gave more legroom. The seats? Well the usual abysmal so called ""Club Europe.""

"✅ Verified Review |  Tokyo Haneda to London, and British Airways is cost cutting all the time! I was extremely disappointed with the onboard catering. For a 12 hours flight there were no mid flight snacks or food. The tuck box vanished from your offering. We got served a small breakfast at departure (9am Tokyo time) and nothing until 90 minutes before landing. Pretty much 10 hours with no food!  So not only the food available seems to have been reduced but it is also very poorly timed.  It looks like despite BA's good profits, they are cost cutting to extreme levels.

"✅ Verified Review |  I had a perfectly satisfactory flight with British Airways to Boston and back this month (Oct 2016). I slept most of the way had a nibble at the food the quality of which might be declining although at altitude my taste buds are pathetic and had no alcohol. The only reason I fly first class is that the beds are more comfortable than club world and I dislike the club seating arrangement. Apart from breakfast scrambled eggs I hardly eat on long haul. Generally speaking, the cabin crews are good and attentive and it's a bonus if you get some ex Concorde crew. I never want to board the aircraft early as I know that I will not have trouble stowing my bags in first.

"✅ Verified Review |  San Francisco to Manchester via Heathrow. Marginal improvement from the outbound leg of this journey. A 2 year old A380, the seats were much nicer than the 777-200 outbound flight - seat 82a, I did like the extra storage bin to the side of the seat by the window which freed up room on the floor (can't say if that's a good thing for BA or standard on this aircraft though as it was my first A380 flight). That's the positives out of the way. No sense of organisation to the boarding process just 400 folk stood by a gate. Cabin crew looked uninterested during boarding. 7pm departure so I was looking forward to getting a meal and getting to sleep early to try get back on uk time as best as I could. At 9:30pm meal arrived, no choice offered and bits missing of both mine and my partners meals. I got a bread roll she didn't, she got a dessert I didn't, neither of us got a drink and by gosh it was a travesty I had the cheek to ask a member of cabin crew for a Diet Coke! Woke for breakfast after a few hours sleep and instantly regretted it. A folded omelette 2.5 potato wedges and a cherry tomato, (breakfast of kings). The final couple of hours was spent watching the interactive map to see how long I had left to suffer and listening to the cabin crew in the back moaning about various things in their personal lives.

"✅ Verified Review |  After many years of flying on BA, being a gold member for the last 6 years, I have finally lost my patience with BA.  There is no point BA even having a customer relations team as it seems there hands are now firmly tied to be able to do anything for a loyal customer when things go wrong. I recently spent over £4000 on a flight to Singapore, outbound being First and inbound in Club World. The plane was a fairly new A380 and on the outbound journey, the plane developed issues in the toilets where the toilets were not be drained properly. The crew on board did their best looking after things but still wasn’t a very pleasant experience from the passengers (and the crew might I add!).  On the Inbound a few days later, we were delayed by 3 hours because of a pump issue in the toilets where there was no running water throughout the entire plane (must have been the same aircraft as the outbound). The ground crew did everything to try and fix it because they didn’t feel it was fair departing on a 13 hour voyage with no running water in the toilets. It meant no running water to flush the toilet (although the suction system still worked), and not running taps to clean ourselves, and of course no tea of coffee facilities. 3 hours had passed and the crew decided to depart anyway, the answer was to load the plane with loads of bottled water and wipes in the toilets but no tea or coffees throughout the whole journey (they had to get the plane to land back at LHR just before the 3 hour delay to stop each passengers claiming 300 EUR under the EU compensation policy (the plane landed back to LHR 2hr 54 min late!). To top things off, after landing back to LHR, the ground crew from BA forgot to tell the airport ground crew of a late gate change which resulted in the bags delivery being delayed by a further 1hr 30 min. So in summary, I get home 5 hours later than planned with toilet issues on the outbound, which created a bit of a smell around the whole aircraft, and toilet issues on the way back delaying the plane and making an uncomfortable journey on the way back and seriously delaying my arrival back home with the baggage issues added to it. Everyone has the right to get a decent amount of compensation in this situation regardless of the class they are travelling in - the answer from BA customer relations was 15,000 Avios Points! What’s 15,000 going to get me? Surely I ask you can do more and the lovely lady on the phone (who seems embarrassed herself having to tell me) couldn’t do anymore as the supervisor’s decision is final. Can I speak to the supervisor I ask? (I am thinking as a loyal member spending so much on BA he/she might have the decency to speak to me), the answer was no, they don’t speak to anyone.

"My wife and I have been flying British Airways short haul in Club Europe for several years and until recently have been more than satisfied with the service provided. Noticeably, this year that service has become far more erratic culminating in an extremely poor performance and unpleasant experience on this recent flight to Malta ex Gatwick. Departure time was 0750 and we arrived at Premium Check-in at 0620 to find only one member of staff manning the desks serving First and Club. There were at least 10 parties waiting in the queue, some of whom defected to Economy desks which were heavily manned with faster moving queues. Only after more than 15 minutes did extra staff arrive and when we reached the desk the attitude of the Check-in lady left much to be desired - robotic, unsmiling and disinterested is probably a kind description. It would have been good to have been informed that the No 1 Lounge was available in the absence of the BA offering, but no mention of a lounge was made at all. The No 1 Lounge struggles to cope with the additional passenger load, but that is another story. Boarding was fine, but the in-flight service from a totally disinterested cabin crew was perfunctory at best. The meal service was late and slow with no drinks of any sort offered until after all meals had been dispensed. Clearing the meal was even worse. The flight was in final approach to Luqa when, returning from the toilet, I saw one of the cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her I-pad whilst bottles and glasses remained at seats which then had to be hurriedly removed as the Captain announced ""cabin crew to seats for landing"". Should I have apologised for being a mere passenger interrupting this lady's games session? Appalling - and such a contrast to several LHR-PRG early morning flights over recent years when it has been a joy to fly BA.

"Flew with British Airways for the first time from Sydney to London return. Very unsatisfactory compared to premium economy experiences with other airlines. Had to pay to preselect seats and not only was there no priority boarding, the World Traveller Plus customers in fact were the last to board. There were only 6 rows of premier economy, yet was told that the meal choice has ran out. The meal took me back to air travel in the 1970s. The starter consisted of 6 tasteless pasta spiral and 1 cherry tomato. The fish was dry and tasteless and the rice an unappetising grey colour. The dessert was a square of plain cheesecake. Hot beverages at breakfast were served in thin paper cups. There was no other service, no offer of water or snacks between the meals. Toiletry consisted of hand wash and nothing else. The toilets were not cleaned and replenished during the stop over in Singapore. The seat was comfortable enough but has only a foot rest rather than the leg rest of other airlines.

"Singapore to Heathrow. British Airways gave me something I wasn't expecting - probably my worst long-haul flight experience ever. Clearly BA's cost-cutting measures have been primarily concerned with turning economy travel into the genuine 'cattle-class' experience. They really need to up their game to compete with Singapore Airlines and Emirates - who deliver economy class travel at a completely different level. BA - where do I start? Cramped seats - even felt extremely small to the children (6 and 8) and little leg room. That feels quite tortuous after 5 hours of travel, let alone 12. The food was laughable - yes, it says on the marketing blurb there are 12+ menus to choose from, but it fails to mention that they are inedible. I thought the children's meals of macaroni cheese would be a safe bet - the grey gelatinous block that turned up made even the cabin crew blush.

"✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Budapest with British Airways. Yet another abysmal flight with BA. The majority of passangers these days seem to be large tour groups. Perhaps that's why service standards and comfort resemble a 1970s charter flight. The cheaper no checked baggage tickets, allowing a ridiculous 23kg of hand luggage, cause chaos on boarding, with 2 or even 3 people needed to lift heavy luggage into the lockers. Consequently aisles are blocked and while these manoeuvres take place. All semblance of orderly boring has been abandoned, there is no welcome on board, only desparate shrieking from flight attendants to be seated quickly and to place anything small enough under the seat in front to accommodate said oversized hand luggage. The seats on my flight were hard and uncomfortable. Cabin so called service, was nonexistant. The packaged inedible offering passing as breakfast was thrust at passangers with no finesse, and accompanied by half a plastic cup of cold stewed tea. The cabin staff seemed hell bent on racing through ""meal"" service to maximise time available to chat in the galley.

"✅ Verified Review |  Washington Dulles to Nairobi via London.

After 45 minutes of waiting, they were finally able to get a back up system going and I was checked in and off to their Lounge. Great meal and service there. My flying companion didn't want to splurge on a 1st Class ticket so she was in Business Class. It wasn't long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst she's seen. BA has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight, meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when you're asleep. Well I sprung for an $850 upgrade for her and all was well. Until the captain announced that there was an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart.

"We recently flew British Airways business class from Calgary to Rome via London and returned the same route. Like previous reviews we too will avoid British Airways at all costs. Although the cabin service and staff on all of our routes was exceptional the layout of the international business class seating is brutal! Who designs seating where you have to either bother your fellow traveler to get out or climb over their feet?  Even worse is what British Airways sells as business class within Europe. They are nothing more than economy seats with the middle one blocked off. My husband is 6'4"" and I'm 5'10"" and our knees were jammed up against the seat in front of us. Could you make your passengers feel anymore cramped?! My biggest complaint about British Airways is having to pay to reserve my seats! They are the only international carrier that does this. Even in business class. When I logged on 24 hours in advance, there were no seats to choose from - and to my utter surprise my husband and I weren't even seated together. Shame on you British Airways for being so cheap! We are flying to Europe again shortly and will definitely be looking elsewhere!

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Geneva return. Appalling airline. The booking process is dreadful - they charge if you want to change seat in economy, I have been told they will be charging for food and drink from January, and the website very difficult to use. Their customer ""service"" via phone or email is abysmal (they are extremely rude, give completely wrong information, and I have been cut off, given wrong numbers and put through to loop messages). Whilst some of the cabin staff are lovely, many are extremely unhelpful.

The call centre in India refused to help fix it, saying I couldn't manage his booking because it wasn't in my name! Then we had a three hour delay at LCY - something to do with them miscalculating the weight allowance. During that time BA didn't give us any food or drink, and gave us no updates as to what was happening. We landed just under three hours late, so couldn't get compensation. Return journey at Malaga, another one hour delay. After we got back tried to collect Avios points on website, but kept getting 'system error'.

"✅ Verified Review |  
Come on British Airways. Really. I have flown BA long haul on two journeys in the last four weeks. First from LIM-LHR and now LHR-DEN. I know that BA has refurbished some of their B747-400 and B777 but the rest are a disgrace. As a flag carrier, what message does this send to the rest of the world? On a positive note, the cabin crew are always polite (sometimes to the point of being passive-aggressive), but this is a humourless service. Even London Underground has moved from the dated uniforms. The in-flight catering is lack-lustre. I choose vegan because the standard meals are truly awful. You now even have to pay for the snacks between meals (unlike KLM or LATAM). I understand the economics are difficult, given that some nations subsidise flag carriers, but small and low-cost changes would make a major difference. Firstly, smarten up the staff (have you seen the LAN uniforms?). On the last flight, one crew member hadn't shaved and it wasn't designer stubble. Get some humour training into the crew and just make passengers flight comfortable. The IFS systems are so dated that they match the reruns of old BBC sitcoms/ soaps offered. On a positive note: 1) I believe BA is a safe airline and the crew professional. Big bonus point for me. 2) When there is a problem, BA is efficient in sorting it out. 3) Communication from the cockpit is usually good.",4,2016-10-07, United Kingdom ,False,review come british airway really flown ba long haul two journey last four week first lim lhr lhr den know ba refurbished b b rest disgrace flag carrier message send rest world positive note cabin crew always polite sometimes point passive aggressive humourless service even london underground moved dated uniform flight catering lack lustre choose vegan standard meal truly awful even pay snack meal unlike klm latam understand economics difficult given nation subsidise flag carrier small low cost change would make major difference firstly smarten staff seen lan uniform last flight one crew member shaved designer stubble get humour training crew make passenger flight comfortable ifs system dated match rerun old bbc sitcom soap offered positive note believe ba safe airline crew professional big bonus point problem ba efficient sorting communication cockpit usually good
"Being a gold Exec Member and this was a redemption flight one should not really complain. But if I was paying 4000 UK for this I would be out raged. The Aircraft at B777-200 well past its sell by date. The Crew whilst personable and very pleasent look bored. The food is a disgrace, wines (white warm), reds (cold) so bad as when I asked for the Business class menu to compare it with First, was superior in every way. Example being First - Soup versus Business Crab Tian? The CSD just apologised and said I know its a disgrace but we keep telling them. Aircraft was so old the ceiling fell in with the celoptape loosing its grip and some foam plate hung out. It really is past a laugh asking people to pay their rates. Overall I find BA moving to a 3 star, its overall product is lazy, apathetic, inconsistent and tired.

"I hadn't flown with BA for quite a number of years, so after seeing their new fleet, I was expecting something 'modern'. Instead, it was like being in a time warp. The aircraft had seen better days, in my opinion, and judging by the IFE equipment and the inner design, damaged lights and uncomfortable seats it showed. Our nearest toilet was out of action, not good. The crew were okay, the service was okay, it was just a convenient way of 'A to B' in my opinion, nothing else. Only until this airline manage to update everything they offer, utilise (aircraft wise) and provide as much emphasis on their everyday economy folk as they do on their frequent fliers, I may consider them again.

A note on the ground service: the way it is set up - with a line for bag drop among others and multiple counters that can call for this and that spread out - leads to some people not hearing being called.

"Toronto to Lisbon connecting in London (outward) and stopover in London (return) with British Airways. A mix of Premium Economy and Economy. Easy check in at Toronto where the staff are great and the club lounge as usual was clean, welcoming and well run. OK boarding with juice and water offered on boarding. Bizarrely, no sparkling wine offered (""Sir - we only offer sparkling wine on flights from London"") No hot towel after take off but menu card offered. One round of drinks followed by dinner. Steak was overcooked, dry and with a greasy gravy - the worst meal to date. The biggest insult was the breakfast which has been downgraded from the ""muffin or nothing"" to a basket of smaller muffins, chocolate and cereal bars plus tea / coffee and juice. Just when you thought BA couldn't stoop any lower, they manage to find something else to nickel and dime. Good club lounge in T3 with decent showers. The flight from London to Lisbon was one of the best short haul flights for me. A younger mixed fleet crew were really friendly, offered great service and a prompt drink and snack service - a tasty roll (2 bites) and a desert (1 bite) with second drinks provided on request. Returning from Lisbon, a dreadful bus transfer to the aircraft, a more sullen and older crew with average service with the mini savory roll replaced by sweet or savory snacks (shameful that BA are increasing the sugar on offer across most flights with the current diabetes debate). The BA lounge on the B gates at T5 remains my favourite lounge with plenty of space and some peace and quiet. Onboard one of the old 747's with the old configuration with PE in front of biz class with juice, water or sparkling wine offered on boarding. My IFE had frozen before I sat down and even after reset had a mind of it's own. The safety video was abandoned soon after starting for a manual demo as there were clearly IFE issues across this aging 747. I finally gave up watching TV as the channel kept changing. No hot towels again. One drinks round and on asking for the little bag of pretzels, I was told they had be cut by embarrassed crew (at around 10p a bag - really?) A vile coleslaw starter, a choice of steak or butter chicken curry which I had and a small pot of chocolate pudding completed dinner. The chicken was tasty but not a business class entree (as claimed) by any stretch of the imagination. Tea and coffee but no after dinner drinks (had already been cut). The biggest insult in this continuing degradation of service is the scrapping of the second meal. The sandwich has gone with either 1 cookie or single finger of chocolate with tea / coffee with clearly embarrassed crew (again). This constant reduction in the PE product with the small stuff can't go much lower - there's only the seats and space left! Ironically, whilst in Lisbon the announcement was made regarding short haul food and drink being charged for in economy. BA are being disingenuous to suggest that people are asking for improved catering - yes, they're asking because you've cut the service back so much in the first place. I'd pay for a decent M&S sandwich but I enjoy my free drink. Charging for tea / coffee and juice - even Air Canada haven't stooped that low. I really worry for BA's future. The drive to improve the bottom line has gone too far. I don't see fares being reduced to reflect the reduced service.

"✅ Verified Review |  Flew British Airways to/from Heathrow recently as first experience. Have read a number of previous reviews commenting about the indifferent attitudes of cabin service. I absolutely agree, and what a shame. But BA, if you actually read some of these reviews, you can actually retrain and improve our perceptions quickly. When boarding, rather than just pointing to which aisle to begin walking down, actually have your cabin staff positioned (even in economy!) to assist passengers struggling to load carry on baggage and to get seated and out of the way of others. Many of us are unfamiliar with the somewhat different controls on the newer 777's. Perhaps a handout as we board or a bit of cabin assistance? On long transatlantic flights, cabin stewards disappear for at least 4-5 hours mid flight. Perhaps an occasional trip down the cabin once every hour or two to ask if customers need anything?

I didn't think there was much turbulence, I've had worse. The crew disappeared for extended periods of time. British Airways are obviously running on the cheap whilst trading on its previous good reputation. This is unacceptable. Compared to the Dreamliner which also has games, USB charging ports, new films and drinks on demand - this is vastly inferior and I will never travel BA again.",5,2016-09-29, United Kingdom ,False,san jose costa rica gatwick british airway unhappy flight seat uncomfortable plane old tv screen scratched appalling watch drink service whole hour flight including meal worse usual get walk seatbelt sign extended period think much turbulence worse crew disappeared extended period time british airway obviously running cheap whilst trading previous good reputation unacceptable compared dreamliner also game usb charging port new film drink demand vastly inferior never travel ba
"Heathrow to Bangkok with British Airways. Fast check-in by friendly staff at LHR. The Galleries lounge was as always were busy but seats were comfortable and the food ok. Boarding started approx. 50 min before departure with boarding through L2. Unlike most of the Middle Eastern airlines we were just pointed in the general direction of our seats rather than shown to them. Aircraft was an older 777-200 in a 3 cabin configuration and the age was showing and while generally clean the trimming was coming apart, the IFE screens were small and the seats felt a bit cramped. Very much like Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class seat, these were great for sitting normally or fully flat but everything in between was a struggle. And the ying-yang seat configuration is akward to say the least but the centre seats are great if you travel as a couple. Welcome drinks were eventually served and we took off only slightly delayed. Dinner was painfully slow and it was a good 3 hours after take off before dinner was finished. Starter and dessert were ok, but the entree was far too overcooked for my taste. Also there is no dine on demand facility, you eat what you are given when it suits the crew. The crew were friendly but painfully slow. It also took more than an hour after dinner before the cabin lights were fully dimmed. Breakfast was served 2 hours before landing and the crew were transformed. It was a quick and efficient service, a shame it took them 9 hours to get to that point. Breakfast was not great but edible. We landed at Bangkok on time but no fast track cards for immigration were given. Bags arrived on the belt only minutes after we had passed through immigration. It is clear that BA have been cutting costs in their premium cabin and it shows in spades when compared to the Middle Eastern 3, the Asian airlines and even the US airlines. They could benefit from cutting the very generous bagage allowance and use the money saved on fuel on getting a new hard product (seats and cabins) and improving their soft product (food, service, etc), especially given their current price point.

Our preferred airline is Etihad but we decided to try BA as we secured a very competitive First fare. I have never flown BA before but have heard not so good reports, so was a bit apprehensive.

The boarding in SYD was very smooth and we were warmly welcomed by the very professional cabin crew. The 777 First is a 1-2-1 configuration and we had the centre seats with the drop down privacy screen. Departure (1500) was on time and the 9 hour flight up to Singapore was very smooth.

"✅ Verified Review |  San Jose - London Heathrow - San Jose in September 2016 in Premium Economy. Was so excited when British Airways announced the new San Jose service earlier this year. Driving up the 101 to SFO had become a tedious task with traffic getting more and more congested. So was relieved to book out of SJC, a ten minute drive from home. My only one gripe with BA is not being able to select a seat at time of booking without paying an additional fee which should not be necessary in Premium Economy. Night before travel, I was unable to select a seat during on-line check-in, so next day I proceeded to the airport only to be told no seat was available due to over-booking. Was provided an $800 compensation credit card to fly the following day which I gladly accepted. The Boeing 787 is a beautiful quiet airplane and a good choice of aircraft for this route. Was given juice upon boarding and a hot towel. Only one drink service after take-off and only one shot of whiskey was provided. Dinner service included a choice from the Club World cabin menu. Full English breakfast prior to landing. Return trip, given glass of champagne upon boarding and hot towel. Lunch was a Filet of Beef. Mid-flight snack box was a let down and afternoon tea included a pizza. Cabin crew were OK and nothing exceptional on both sectors.

"✅ Verified Review |  Bahrain to Boston via London. First time flying BA after flying Qatar, Emirates and Oman Air business class. Check in at BAH was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in area. BA uses the Dilmun lounge, which is basic but adequate. The flight from BAH to LHR was on a 777. The seats are in a 2x4x2 configuration and are very narrow (similar to premium economy seats, and marginally larger than the economy seats) though reasonably comfortable. When fully flat there is not much room, and people over 6 feet will struggle. There was hardly any storage space, and the IFE screen was very small and of poor quality. The food was very average (I had the carrot and pumpkin soup). Cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tired. The lounge in Heathrow is large, but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably. The bathrooms in both the main BA lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they get. The quality of food in the lounge is average, though the wine and spirit selection is decent. The flight from LHR to BOS was on a 747 and this was similar to the 777 - old and tired with cramped seating for business class. Cabin crew were a bit better on this leg, though still disengaged. The food was of average quality, though the wine list, while small, was good. Overall, BA has the feel of a budget carrier compared to some of its middle eastern counterparts. The lounge is sub par, particularly when compared to the Qatar lounge in Doha, or even the Qantas / One World lounge in LAX. The business class ticket was reasonably cheap, though I can now see why.

"We flew from Heathrow to Kos on Tuesday 13th September departing at 07.25. As the flying time was between 3.5 and 4 hours long, we had contemplated flying Club Europe but with identical legroom to the economy seats, it didn't seem worth the money. We checked in around 05.15 and having previously paid to reserve our seats, everything went smoothly as most of terminal 5 seemed very quiet. I had tried to find out in advance what food (if any) might be offered on the flight as we would have preferred not eat breakfast at 06.00 in the terminal. However, despite knowing people that work for British Airways, it seemed quite difficult as the web site is rather ambiguous. Having said that, I did find out that the food offered depends on what band your flight is classified as but try as I may, I couldn't find the LHR to Kos on any of the bands. In the end we had tea and toast at Gordon Ramsey's which was expensive but a lot quieter than the other outlets serving breakfast. Boarding was on time although we did have to catch a bus to somewhere near terminal three which took around 10 minutes. The plane seemed little more than half full which obviously speeded up boarding and we left a little early. The cabin crew were polite, friendly and efficient and we were offered a sandwich and a drink for breakfast, which was fine. As we had a spare seat in our row of three, it effectively meant that we had the same space as Club, which made the flight a little more comfortable. We arrived a little early in Kos after a slightly bumpy landing but we were through customs and had our bags within half an hour. Overall a good flight and BA must have a tough job selling their Club Europe seats unless of course passengers want to, pay hundreds of pounds for lounge access and a hot breakfast.",9,2016-09-25, United Kingdom ,False,flew heathrow ko tuesday th september departing flying time hour long contemplated flying club europe identical legroom economy seat seem worth money checked around previously paid reserve seat everything went smoothly terminal seemed quiet tried find advance food might offered flight would preferred eat breakfast terminal however despite knowing people work british airway seemed quite difficult web site rather ambiguous said find food offered depends band flight classified try may find lhr ko band end tea toast gordon ramsey expensive lot quieter outlet serving breakfast boarding time although catch bus somewhere near terminal three took around minute plane seemed little half full obviously speeded boarding left little early cabin crew polite friendly efficient offered sandwich drink breakfast fine spare seat row three effectively meant space club made flight little comfortable arrived little early ko slightly bumpy landing custom bag within half hour overall good flight ba must tough job selling club europe seat unless course passenger want pay hundred pound lounge access hot breakfast

"✅ Verified Review |  My husband and I flew from Atlanta to London and it was a nightmare experience. First the flight was delayed of 2 hours and since we had to make a connection in London to go to Geneva, we only had 45 minutes do so and it was a nightmare. No one to helped us, we had to run like crazy in the airport. We had to pass security and immigration one more time, we finally made it but we were the very last ones to board the plane to Geneva as it was about to close is door. I was shocked that British Airways did not provide us with any assistance, obviously they do not care about their customers. On our way back, the flight from Geneva to London was late by more than 40 minutes, and we had to run again in order to catch our flight to Atlanta. We flew in premium economy that does not even have its own bathroom, when you are in premium economy, there is only one bathroom for about 150 people and it is a shared one with people in economy. The food is non existent, one ounce of salad and four once of a ""so-called"" meal + dessert and watery coffee. You will be left hungry, so don't rely on their food because it is more than a huge disappointment. We paid $3800 for this trip and I regret choosing this airline. Premium economy is not worth the extra fee, you only get 7 inches more than in economy but that's it. You will struggle to find a bathroom available and the food is exactly the same than in economy. That's it.  I will not fly with them again and for everyone who is interested to make a flight connection in London Heathrow, please make other arrangements as it is a huge airport and British Airways flights are late.

"✅ Verified Review |  Abu Dhabi to Heathrow return. Probably one of the worst flight/travel experiences me and my family have had to endure! From what was supposed to be a joyous occasion for us as a family taking our daughter to the UK to get settled into university turned into an experience that will make sure that we never fly British Airways again. First when checking in in Abu Dhabi the flight was cancelled due to technical problems with their new Boeing 787. Of course flights get cancelled and we fully understand but what was rediculous was the total lack of communication. Passengers stood around for hours with no one knowing what was going on, eventually a check in clerk told the passengers to come back the next day at 10 am for check in. The actual flight time was 14:00, then the plane was delayed yet again. British Airways staff were no where to be found! Eventually a supposed British Airways manager arrived. We then couldn't check in because the system was broken, after an hour they decided to manually check us in and we were away to get our daughter settled in Uni.! Arriving at Heathrow, two hours to clear customs because they were short staffed. Then on to collect bags only to find that my daughters bag for Uni was missing, apparently never made the flight and no one knows where it is. Again no communication from British Airways despite several calls to them each day and the crazy thing is that you have to repeat the story to every service centre person that answers the phone. Sad thing is that in the move to Uni she had packed a few sentimental items into her check in bag, when we explained this to the BA phone operator, she was told that was probably not the wisest decision. Thank you BA for the great advice. Now sitting on the plane returning to home to Abu Dhabi (same plane) 6 days later and the plane is delayed again due to hydraulic fluid leaking from the engine. Great you found the leak! But a new plane all these problems! Seriously British Airways, should you not test your new aircraft before you haul passengers around the world.

"✅ Verified Review |  Madrid to Perth via Singapore. So disappointed with BA. Really useless airline. Flight delayed on arrival to London 3 hours and no reason given. Missed connecting flight to Perth from Singapore. Was given Pay-in lounge access and this was better than nothing but I wonder why they couldn't have just given me access to their lounge. I decided to give them a chance since avoiding BA/QF flying between Australia and Europe but I never will again. Pay to reserve seats? Pay to request meal? I guess BA is positioning itself as a budget airline, but its price doesn't reflect that yet. It's a shame as I enjoy the transit through Singapore rather than the gulf states.

"✅ Verified Review |  Miami to London Heathrow with British Airways in First Class. The boarding process at Miami was chaotic with the staff member inviting World Traveller Plus, Club World and First Class to all join the queue to board. Despite flying First Class it took 15 minutes to get to the front of the queue and a further 10 minutes on the jet bridge before getting onboard. The crew were indifferent and we were not escorted to our seats. The ""hot"" towel service before take off was a cold dry towel which had not seen any hot water. The ""hot"" nuts were served 10 minutes after the drinks. The meal was dry and of poor quality. The cabin crew forgot my partners main course and put one in the oven 30 minutes after everyone else had eaten and when it was served, it was cold and inedible. When the crew member made my bed up I was informed they had ""run out"" of duvets and the crew only managed to find one after I complained about the poor experience to the CSM. Based on this experience, BA's penny pinching across all of the cabins has lowered the quality of all of the product and it is not worth paying for First Class - save yourself some money because United Airlines Economy Class is better than what I experienced on this flight.",7,2016-09-18, United Kingdom ,False,review miami london heathrow british airway first class boarding process miami chaotic staff member inviting world traveller plus club world first class join queue board despite flying first class took minute get front queue minute jet bridge getting onboard crew indifferent escorted seat hot towel service take cold dry towel seen hot water hot nut served minute drink meal dry poor quality cabin crew forgot partner main course put one oven minute everyone else eaten served cold inedible crew member made bed informed run duvet crew managed find one complained poor experience csm based experience ba penny pinching across cabin lowered quality product worth paying first class save money united airline economy class better experienced flight
"✅ Verified Review | We flew as a group of 4 from Heathrow to Krakow in Club Europe. The aircraft was clean and newish so had the new ""economy"" seats in the Club section. I would like to know who at British Airways sanctions the use of these tiny seats in Club (I know its nice to have the middle seat blocked but I would prefer a bigger seat to sit in - maybe BA should have a look at Turkish Airlines Biz cabin!) The service outbound was just adequate - one drinks round, then a dinner service (BA872) which was edible but slopping / dumping the meal out of a heated plastic container into a china dish in front of the passenger lacks some grace to say the least. Are the crew trained to do this or was it just bone idleness not to prepare the meal in the galley then serve to the passenger? In all, the outbound journey was just about passable but not comfortable given the seating. Now for the return - what a joke! Nn lounge at Krakow - that's right you squeeze onto the end of that overcrowed bench by the gate and keep quiet! The flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours, so by the time boarding started it was a scrum (priority boarding abandoned) to get through the gate as most passengers were so fed up. British Airways prefer not to pay for airbridge access to the plane so we were then treated to a nice ride in an old banger bus crammed to the gills with sweaty fed up passengers all trying to avoid other peoples armpits. Once on the plane the same tiny seats, although we were winners all round as we managed to bag 1A and 1C so at least we had some leg room. The meal service on this leg really did make me giggle. The steward offered a shriveled chicken salad (leg meat skewers), or get this, a boxed sandwich. I actually had to ask if that was it? He replied ""yes"" to which I replied ""so who's eaten all the food?"" He laughed and actually said we were lucky, and if I had any food with me could he have some! And I'm not making this up. Once at LHR it took 1h for the bags to turn up by which time the Pod service to the parking had stopped (and that turned into a complete drama but I won't go there on this ocassion). So - what did we get for our Club fare to Krakow? In my opinion very little, and what we did get was rubbish. If anyone is thinking of going to Krakow with BA my advice is save your money and fly economy (with another airline), and spend the saving having fun there. In fact choose another airline since BA on this route are just a joke. I have been Club Europe hundreds of times over the last 20 years and the gradual decline in the product has now just about reached the point where once I have used up my 300K Avios it'll be Bye Bye BA for good.

Not only was the flight delayed by an hour both ways, but due to a baggage error they made on the return flight, I only just boarded the aircraft on time. On both flights they ran out of one of the food options, leaving only the vegetarian dish. They onboard entertain system was low quality - a small screen with poor resolution. Seats were more uncomfortable than many other airlines I've flown in economy, Their only saving grace is the generous trolley bar allowance. I had connected from MIA to BOG with Avianca - they are a much better airline. Seats were more comfortable and entertainment system of a much higher quality, and they had USB charging in economy.

"London to Johannesburg return. Still waiting for a reply, after 6 attempts via email, post and phone to make contact. On flight BA 0055 to Johannesburg the inflight service was the worst we have ever experienced. We took off around 19h30, and were only offered a drink at 21h30. This was the only drink offered that night. Dinner was served at 22h30, no drinks accompanied this. We were surprised to see we were sitting in the back row of the plane, which was not what was shown on the diagram when we booked and paid extra for selecting our seats when we made the booking. We did not have a choice of meals as they had run out, all we were offered was a very poor excuse for a mushroom risotto, which was inedible. It took over an hour for the trays to be cleared away. Breakfast was served to the special diets around 04h30, waking the entire section where we were seated, then the lights turned off for another hour until we were offered an equally horrible breakfast. Coffee was not offered at all - the amount of liquids offered was below minimum requirements, if we had not taken our own water with us we would have had a problem. When we departed the plane it look like a rubbish tip, no waste had been collected during the flight, the cabin staff were surly and uninterested. Prior to this flight we tried to avoid the “back of plane” issues by paying an additional £56.00 for exit row seats. The payment was accepted and receipt issued via email. When we went to check in online our original seats had been allocated again. When we arrived at Johannesburg airport we were told that the seats were no longer available and had been allocated to other passengers. No apology or explanation was given. Not the way we wanted our holiday to end. The service on this flight was as to be expected, regular drinks offered (water throughout the night), the only negatives being no choice for dinner and a poor breakfast. Cabin staff were very good. We have not received a refund for the £56.00 paid for the exit row seats, and I await an explanation as to why these seats were not allocated to us. Even though we were flying economy, we expect a level of service and edible food. If the back rows are to receive less or no choice on food and drinks then they should be charged less. This is unfair and bad business practice. Upon speaking to other people who have flown with BA, the general consensus seems to be that only first / business class passengers seem to be valued, and our experience confirms this. BA were not the cheapest flights by far, we opted to fly with them due to reputation, which was sorely let down.

Yet when I looked yesterday at the option of paying £15 for a seat reservation before online check-in opens, there was a good choice available.

"✅ Verified Review |  Took a domestic flight from Knoxville to Atlanta for onward British Airways flight to Heathrow. Went to BA to check in only to be told that they did not have my reservation so I needed to resolve it with my travel agent. Check in staff not bothered and bordered on being rude. Finally resolved the issue after about an hour with the assistance of my agent. Lounge in Atlanta was mediocre at best. Flight itself was fine and the crew were very attentive but meals weren't anything special. I'd say BA First Class is average at best when compared to Emirates or Singapore Airlines.

"Naples to London Gatwick. The aircraft was fairly new (which made a nice change compared to the many ancient long haul planes we've flown on with BA). We'll ignore all the reasons for the flight being slightly delayed and go straight to our complaint: having left our hotel too early for breakfast we decided to wait for the food usually served on the plane. As we didn't land until 1pm we assumed there would be some lunch offered. We were offered a soft drink and the choice of a bag of crisps or a bag of nuts! We complained and were told that this was the policy on certain flights since the beginning of August. What a disgrace. We regularly fly BA and are silver card holders, however, we've decided to fly our next two long haul flights with Emirates. The BA planes we've flown on lately on long haul flights have been dated and not very clean, and the standard of the food in business class has gradually declined in quality.

"✅ Verified Review |  The many problems I had with my outbound flight paled in comparison to my return. On arrival at T3 from another carrier I went to the BA baggage check in and was told that unlike every other major carrier in a major hub airport anywhere on the planet, BA cannot possibly transfer bags to my departure terminal, T5. The agent made it clear it could be done but that she would get in trouble. Fast Track security was woefully slow and incompetent. When I arrived at the gate boarding had commenced. Though I had purchased a business upgrade to avoid some of the horrible service I had received on my outbound flight and despite having only two carry on items and despite management's false statements in their replies to my earlier complaints that ""Our hand baggage allowance at two bags with a 23kg limit for the is also one of the most generous"", despite the fact that the flight was not full and more than half of the bin space in business class was empty, I was forced to check my bag carry-on compliant bag. The flight attendants were rather shocked about this and later apologized for the gate agent's unwarranted behavior. The flight was okay with the same uncomfortable coach seats in business class and an inedible food offering. In all a waste of money for BA's ""vaulted"" business class ""experience."" The recent Economist article about BA's race to the bottom service tier and the reneged promises made along the way speaks volumes about management's hostility towards customers and especially BA and OW elites.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Moscow. I was supposed to travel with BA 233 today. I had a previous flight coming from Dallas which was a little late. As soon as no one met me at the arrival I assumed that I have plenty of time and did not rush to the gate. When I arrived to the gate 5 mins before closing the lady said that BA moved me to another flight because this flight was full and my previous plane delayed. I was really surprised because there were a lot of passengers still at the gate and I was not the last one. I asked if the company will compensate me for the cancellation because I will miss another connecting flight in Moscow. She said that the company will not compensate me anything because it is not the company's fault.  After what she said that I am not listening and she will cancel my next flight that BA transferred me to - BA 235. I asked why and she said that I should listen and then I'll understand. I listened again, but could not understand few things still. Why no one met me at the arrival if there was a risk of me being late.

"✅ Verified Review |  Vienna - London Gatwick - Porto in March 2016 in Economy, VIE-LGW 2o minutes early, LGW-OPO almost on time after a 20 minutes departure delay. Web-check did not work. After having entered all the required personal and passport details manually, the system informed me that “no web-check-in is offered for this flight”. Quite irritating, as this information could have been easily shown at the start of the procedure. Having Oneworld Sapphire status I used the manned premium check-in counter and was able to score an aisle/window seat. This worked fine with no lines but required to be at the airport earlier than intended, as BA charges extra for all seat selections (even for a middle seat at the back of the plane). Boarding for both flights was fine and hassle free. Service on the VIE-LGW leg was rather lacklustre for BA, but cabin crew was professional and the flight deck - as per usual for BA - great. Much better FA’s on the LGW-OPO leg and again flight deck excellent. Full bar service on both flights and a sandwich was served as well. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE, which is on the poor side, rather small and cramped, with limited food options. However, the hot item of the day tends to be of good quality. Snacks and drinks fall in the discount category. Lounge experience in LGW was very unsatisfactory. BA closed their own lounge at LGW to give up the space for another airline’s lounge and uses pay-per-entry No 1 Lounge, which was so crowded that even finding a place to just sit down was a challenge. Furthermore food and alcoholic drinks have to be ordered at the - slightly chaotic - bar off a menu. Food is then delivered to your seat; a time consuming process in a lounge that is filled beyond capacity. My understanding is that this arrangement will last well into 2017 before BA opens up a new lounge. Why BA gives up its own lounge space in its hub airport to accommodate another airline is beyond me. Overall solid experience in the air, but not so good on the ground. Will consider BA for further travel in Economy short haul, if fares are competitive, but will avoid departing from LGW. As for business class, I have stopped using BA a while ago due to the condensed seating arrangements on both short haul and long haul flights.",1,2016-09-05, Austria ,False,review vienna london gatwick porto march economy vie lgw minute early lgw opo almost time minute departure delay web check work entered required personal passport detail manually system informed web check offered flight quite irritating information could easily shown start procedure oneworld sapphire status used manned premium check counter able score aisle window seat worked fine line required airport earlier intended ba charge extra seat selection even middle seat back plane boarding flight fine hassle free service vie lgw leg rather lacklustre ba cabin crew professional flight deck per usual ba great much better fa lgw opo leg flight deck excellent full bar service flight sandwich served well ba us shared lounge vie poor side rather small cramped limited food option however hot item day tends good quality snack drink fall discount category lounge experience lgw unsatisfactory ba closed lounge lgw give space another airline lounge us pay per entry lounge crowded even finding place sit challenge furthermore food alcoholic drink ordered slightly chaotic bar menu food delivered seat time consuming process lounge filled beyond capacity understanding arrangement last well ba open new lounge ba give lounge space hub airport accommodate another airline beyond overall solid experience air good ground consider ba travel economy short haul fare competitive avoid departing lgw business class stopped using ba ago due condensed seating arrangement short haul long haul flight

"✅ Verified Review |  Lisbon to Heathrow on British Airways. I booked my ticket with a reputable travel agency and yet when I went to check-in online the BA website said I had been sold a seat-only flight. The travel agency disagreed and showed me they had booked a seat with a baggage allowance. I called BA and was messed around by their staff member. I had to pay an outrageous fee to have 1 bag of only 12 kg fly in the hold with me to London. At Lisbon airport things were hectic as the previous day their security people had been on strike. The departure board did not show the check-in area for the BA flights. I had to find my own way to where BA check-in. I joined a queue and was outraged when one of the check-in staff allowed a woman with 3 kids to queue jump. When other people objected including other families in the long queue with children the check-in agent did nothing and allowed the woman to get away with not queuing. The check-in lady I dealt with was very pleasant and cheerful. The departure from Lisbon was exceptionally busy with not one empty seat. The cabin crew were very professional. The departure was on time and during the flight a snack and drink was served. My seat was very comfortable and the drop-down screens showed the route followed. Arrival was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Baggage on this flight is an issue in my opinion as too many passengers were allowed to bring on to the flight quite sizeable bags.

Heathrow to Belfast with British Airways. Boarded about 12 noon for 12.55 take off. After some delay we were informed there was a technical fault and engineers had been called. We were offered water or soft drinks initially. We finally took off at 3pm which meant we had been sitting on the plane for 3 hours during which time we were not offered anything at all to eat. It was quite disgraceful for BA. Once airborne we were served tea / coffee / alcoholic drink and a choice of potato crisps. Is this what BA has been reduced to?

I have to be upfront and say the flight from London Heathrow to Boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crew. Over the years British Airways first has gone so far downhill I'm afraid it just can't compete anymore, it needn't be so as the issues as I see them are all resolvable. However, the return leg was like flying with Ryanair. There were only 13 people in the cabin. There were no slippers, 2 of the menu items I requested were, in the words of the crew ""invisible"", and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm. The chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me. My father waited the entire flight, having asked on 3 seperate occasions, for a headset convertor. We were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast, which I then missed assuming I would be woken. There was a palpable tension between the crew, which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers. Once we had disembarked the aircraft, it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked. Finally, we collect our suitcases, which I have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim, only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels. BA have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases. When comparing the service / food to Virgin UC for USA and Etihad First for east bound, BA just doesn't cut the mustard any longer I'm afraid. Such as shame as the seats / bed are great, but why pay the extra £ for service and food that just isn't forthcoming or varies from flight to flight?

"✅ Verified Review |  The British Airways experience has really declined over the past 5 years. I often fly business class and at least premium economy. The Boeing 787 is awesome. Clean, spacious and excellent technology/media options. However the staff and service has declined. Rarely do the staff seem interested in their jobs - they are on automatic pilot. We travel with 3 children and the stroller has become a real problem. Firstly they gave a 5 kg maximum on weight. Try getting a 5 kg stroller that works in Canadian weather! So we bought a new Light stroller - however we have noticed extreme wait times to have the stroller brought to the gate after a flight ends. Try travelling with a 2-3 year old through the chaos of terminal 5 in the summer months without a stroller. With a tight 1 hour lay over we waited over 25 minutes for our stroller- the only reason we got it (ground staff forgot) was because the older and very caring pilot went down the stairs himself to get it! The younger staff could care less and left us and 2 other families alone waiting. They could learn a lot from the pilot. Also every single flight on our journey ended up leaving 1-4 hours late (a mixed blessing we made our layover because of it!). The good in the lounge and on board has suffered as well.

"✅ Verified Review |  Abuja to London Heathrow. This flight took off and landed on time. The jack on the new style headphones didn't fit in the socket, so if I wanted to listen to anything I had to sit and hold the jack in place. There was no toothbrush or toothpaste included in the little package left on seats for customers. The meal served before landing was a choice between a mini Kitkat or a mini mars bar. A far cry from the scone, jam and cream of a couple of years ago - and even worse than the bruschetta, mini breadsticks, tomato salsa, packet of mixed nuts and 2 celebrations of a couple of months ago.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Istanbul return. The outbound flight was delayed, (approx. 2.5 hours), which was very frustrating. Boarding the flight was another hassle in so far as we were bussed from the terminal to the aircraft and then there was confusion around seating arrangements!

Return leg, was on time, but the check in queue was horrendous! The flight left on time, on board entertainment was a struggle as we did not have individual monitors, and we were offered tomato and egg sandwiches again as a meal.

"✅ Verified Review |  I was booked to travel British Airways from Heathrow to Dublin airport in Ireland. I arrived at the airport within the permitted check-in times and was held up by a longer than anticipated queue. I went to a check-in bag drop counter where the staff ignored me for a good few minutes as she conducted a personal conversation with one of her colleagues. I was asked to place my bag onto the conveyor belt and issued a boarding pass and baggage receipt. The woman behind the counter then took the boarding pass back and after a few moments I asked her if there was a problem. She nodded and said her computer system would not let me board as my bag had been offloaded even though the bag was still on the conveyor belt and she had issued me with a boarding pass. After 15 mins she told me to take my bag and go to a different area for help. It was bizarre. I joined a second queue where a very helpful man explained that the first person I dealt with had not checked me correctly due to timings. He made a telephone call and as my flight was delayed by almost one hour he told me not to worry and to make my way to through security to the gate. Boarding was not efficient. One would expect better from BA. The queue was poorly managed. The cabin crew with one exception were frosty and functional. One cabin crew member, an older lady was superb and I saw her help a young mum with a baby and answering questions from 2 Japanese people with limited English. This member of the cabin crew was a superb representative of her airline. My seat was not clean and there were crumbs on the floor. The captain made very clear announcements and there was a nice drop-down screen to show the route of the flight. A cup of tea and a small packet of crisps were offered.  My bag did not arrive into Dublin with me and so I had to join a queue for Swissport. This is where my nightmare started. A uniformed woman who said she represented BA told me my bag would “most likely” not arrive until tomorrow. I asked her if the bag would be on the next flight and she said no and suggested that I leave the airport and that a courier would deliver the bag to where I was staying. I took her advice only to receive an automated email that same evening to inform me that my bag had indeed been placed on the next flight. Over the next few days a nightmare began. I spent many hours calling Swissport and their courier DPD. To be fair the DPD staff were helpful and told me the reference number from Swissport was wrong. Swissport insisted the reference number was correct.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow - Vancouver - London Heathrow. First impressions could have been better as this flight departs from Terminal 3, rather than terminal 5 at Heathrow. The departure lounge was being used by multiple longhaul flights on large aircraft meaning that the area as crammed full with most passengers having to stand and making it difficult to access the departure gates. However the ground staff did their best to manage the situation and were clearly used to having to manage it. Once on board I found the cabin to be very clean. Unlike many airlines, BA offers economy seating upstairs on the A380 where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter than on most other aircraft. However the profile of the cabin means that the overhead lockers are smaller than usual, which could be an issue for those with roller cases. The IFE system provided is excellent. I also ordered one of BA's new gourmet meal offerings rather than take the standard meal. This option was well worth taking up, offering an improved choice and quality. The service provided by the flight attendants was friendly and professional and this is one area where British Airways seems to do consistently well. If I have a criticism it is that the 31 inch seat pitch seems miserly for a 9-10 hour flight. Arrival at Vancouver was on time and I was through immigration and landside in about 20 minutes. Processing through security for departure from YVR was equally efficient. The return flight offered a similar experience to the outward one, although arrival in London was an hour late. However the relatively quiet cabin on the A380 meant that I was able to get some sleep. Unfortunately the arrival experience at LHR terminal 3 was no better than the departure one. A lengthy walk to arrivals concluded with having to join a slow-moving, snaking line to clear immigration.

"✅ Verified Review |  Flew London Heathrow to Washington DC. The Business Class Cabin on a British Airways A380 is unconscionably crammed with seven seats per row. Most other international carriers I've flown limit themselves to no more than four, or, at most, five seats per row in Business Class. In the BA configuration, passengers in the middle of each row are trapped in their seats if their seatmate choses to extend their seat into a flatbed. Also, the seats lack any storage space save a tiny drawer suitable for no more than a pair of shoes, and the seats are claustrophobically narrow. By far the worst Business Class seats I've ever encountered.

"✅ Verified Review |  I fly this route 3-4 times a year, unfortunately there is no competition other than Air Canada. I've had occasional problems - rude staff, freezing planes, poor service - but generally been satisfied. On this last flight a week ago, the plane has been internally reconfigured, and they have placed large metal boxes in the foot area of every third seat that take up approximately 1/3 of the space, and fully restrict the movement of your feet and therefore your legs for the entire journey if you are a normal-sized adult. I have attached a photo of my feet trapped in this space - I offered to send BA this photo but apparently they are not interested as they ignored the offer along with the content of my complaint, see below. The discomfort caused by the reduced foot space was compounded by a delay of 1.5 hours - for which I did not blame the airline - meaning I spent 8 hours in that position rather than 6.5 hours. Then on arrival we in steerage learned that the pre-landing snack had been replaced by a funsize chocolate bar, approximately 2 inches in size. As a result I arrived starving and had to go and eat somewhere after 10pm, and would have brought food on the flight had I known of the miserly cost-cutting measure in advance. I wrote to complain about these aspects of the flight, but primarily the lack of foot space because of the new configuration, as this can't easily be remedied and will put me off using the airline again. I ended my complaint saying I had the distinct impression that there is no respect for economy travellers. I've just received a response which is clearly a cut-and-pasted reply about the 1.5 hour delay and completely ignoring the content of my complaint, indicating that it was not even read, and confiming my impression that they have contempt for the experience of people in economy. Which is particularly shortsighted, as some of us will soon be travelling in higher classes due to changes in our circumstances, and we won't forget how we were treated.

Unfortunately due to renovations at LGW, British Airways are having to utilise a lounge so it wasn't as restful as may otherwise have been but once complete I'm sure that standard will be resumed. On boarding it was nice to be ""welcomed back"", a small but nice touch. Straight after settling into our seats came complimentary drinks, warm towels and our menu choices. BA does a great filet steak and the desserts were fantastic. One of the things I really love about BA is the fact that they have a diverse age range when it comes to their cabin crew. The more ""senior members"" really do know their stuff - the things that only experience gives you and this flight was no exception. Superb service was provided by the cabin crew and even when stretching my legs they were quick to offer refreshments and guide me to the galley where a large selection of snacks/ drinks are available between the regular drink/meal service. The only downsides for me are the seating arrangement that means that those in window or centre seats have to step over other passengers when those passengers are fully reclined and the IFE which really does need an update. I know that the second point is being addressed on the older aircraft.

The plane itself was packed to capacity, probably because this is the only direct carrier on this route. World Traveller is a 3x3x3 configuration. I had chosen an aisle seat in the centre (seat 38D) at the rear to minimise risk of disturbance from other passengers. Leg room is actually pretty good for economy and the new style of seat has plenty of space underneath. Seat width is OK. The adjustable headrest is better than that in Premium Economy (World Traveller Plus) although the seat base is hard. For a 10 hour flight I recommend sitting on the cushion. Service was variable - the VOD in my seat did not work (all I could get was the map) and one of the staff reset it (quite grudgingly I felt) 3 times without success. Thankfully a more senior staff member was able to find the only other unoccupied seat about 3 hours after takeoff. To be expected to put up with a seat without VOD for 10 hours is ridiculous - why do BA not check them after each flight? Plenty of food (breakfast after 2hrs, in then a snack box after 5hrs, then lunch after 8hrs) but, unfortunately, while I thought sitting at the rear would mean being served first, that was not the case, and by the time they got to my row all choice was gone. No connectivity in seat, only earphone socket. VOD choice quite limited compared to other airlines. Unfortunately I think that British Airways have been overtaken these days and will look to the Middle and Far Eastern carriers in future.",5,2016-07-23, United Kingdom ,False,bengaluru london heathrow british airway world traveller started badly check gate boarding world traveller passnegers made feel second class citizen seemed worse bengaluru choatic heathrow plane packed capacity probably direct carrier route world traveller x x configuration chosen aisle seat centre seat rear minimise risk disturbance passenger leg room actually pretty good economy new style seat plenty space underneath seat width ok adjustable headrest better premium economy world traveller plus although seat base hard hour flight recommend sitting cushion service variable vod seat work could get map one staff reset quite grudgingly felt time without success thankfully senior staff member able find unoccupied seat hour takeoff expected put seat without vod hour ridiculous ba check flight plenty food breakfast hr snack box hr lunch hr unfortunately thought sitting rear would mean served first case time got row choice gone connectivity seat earphone socket vod choice quite limited compared airline unfortunately think british airway overtaken day look middle far eastern carrier future

"On our recent British Airways flight from Mauritius to London, we decided to pay for an upgrade. Only to find when we got on the plane that the seats given to us were not functional. We had no entertainment on the 12 hour flight, no power to the seat so could not even read. British Airways are not willing to offer us a refund on the upgrade, as they advise their responsibility is to get us from A to B. The entertainment system are all additional and not part of the ticket price. Even though looking at their website they state ""personal entertainment system with noise-reducing headphones"" as one of the selling points for upgrading or flying premier economy.

✅ Verified Review |  We travelled from Aberdeen to Heathrow and on to San Francisco with no issues other than very poor legroom. Even less legroom than on a local flight to Europe (Ryanair) on a 10 hour flight. On the return journey the first flight from San Francisco to Heathrow was delayed. Once on the plane the flight was ready to go when there was a further delay because the gate staff had somehow mixed up the boarding passes and had a discrepancy. So they had to physically check several passengers to make sure they were who they said they were. Very scary in view of the security situation. Then our row of 3 seats had no in-flight entertainment (row 28) The first flight attendant we talked to fobbed us off for ages and eventually admitted he could not fix it. Then the next level up flight attendant tried and finally the flight director came to see us and offered us an alcoholic drink. So we travelled for 10 hours with no entertainment. On landing at Heathrow our next flight to Aberdeen was also delayed for one hour. On complaining to BA they eventually replied offering us a voucher for 20 pounds.

"We spent extra to be upgraded to First to fly from London Heathrow to Dallas Fort Worth. It was definitely not worth it. The 777 has smaller first class seats, they have expanded the number of seats, too. There are now around 20. Cabin crew were young and clearly without enough experience. Quite unhelpful and it took a long time to get meals - they have been ""taught"" to do everyone individually. That doesn't work when they have expanded the number of passengers. Cabin crew clearly felt their only responsibility was to feed us. They disappeared after lunch for many hours - until it was time for tea. Which is now a meal less adequate than it used to be in Club. Further, First Class food is far from first class. Fewer choices, and what is provided is not good. Very disappointing.

"✅ Verified Review | Basel to London Heathrow with British Airways. At 11.30am I recieved a text telling me that flight BA755 departing 18:10 had been cancelled. 70 minutes later, I recieved a second message telling me that I was rebooked on flight BA749A departing 21:55. On arrival at Basel airport, I discovered the club class check in doubles as a general enquiry point. After a wait of 30 minutes whilst a stream of economy passengers' queries were dealt with, a rude and unhelpful agent checked me in. I asked if the seat 2C, I had prebooked on the cancelled flight was available and was told no, I had been allocated seat 3C and the allocation could not be changed. Seat 2C remained empty. The business lounge was at least superior to the BA one I used on my outward journey, being independantly run. Our incoming flight for BA749 was delayed leaving Heathrow finally landing at 11.25PM. At 10:30pm passengers were informed by the business lounge Concierge that we must clear passport control and be in line at the gate by 11:00pm as the airport closes at midnight so a rapid turnround was needed. The flight eventually pushed back from the stand at 23:50. I wonder if this was a ploy by BA to avoid paying compensation for a 3 hour delay.

"London Heathrow to Zurich - after reading all the negative reviews about British Airways, I was apprehensive as I had not flown on British Airways in over 10 years. I kept my expectations low. And I was not disappointed. Yes, the business class lounge at Terminal 5 was jammed with people. I did find a place at the far end to sit and charge up my phone. The large glass panes afford a panoramic view of the surrounding area and a section of the runways. A good variety of food and drinks but hard to move around given the crowds. The bathrooms could do with more frequent cleaning. As for the flight, it left and arrived on time. I was served a cold chicken salad (no choices) and a dessert and a selection of drinks were offered. The flight attendant servicing the business class section was solicitous. Pilot kept us informed of weather and flight direction. A large monitor in the cabin revealed and updated the flight route. For a relatively short flight, service was fine. True the seats were not larger, nor was leg space more but the middle seat had been covered by a tray and thus empty. Was able to board the plane first and disembark first and had my carry-on bags with me all the time.

"✅ Verified Review |  Sadly British Airways Business Class, London Heathrow to Geneva is no longer worth any extra cost. I'm only 185cm and can't sit comfortably and relax without being sideways. In addition to Chamonix we have homes in London and Telluride, Colorado and BA lost us as customers for quite a few years on the LHR to DEN, 777 service, again because of the ridiculous seat forward/backward seat configuration in Business Class, that requires us or someone else to climb over us to get out of the seat during the flight. Therefore we flew Air NZ (much, much better flight if a little inconvenient) to LAX (6-8 return flights a year) and suffered longer on United to get to our destination as BA Business was so bad. Fortunately they now have a 747 on the LHR to DEN service where we can fly First Class which we are using, but it would only take another airline to do this route for us to move away from the ageing cabin staff and extremely average service.

"I'm extremely disappointed with British Airways and how their service has diminished. My daughter arrived at Milan airport today to catch a 6am flight to London Heathrow and then connecting to Mexico City. She is still at the airport after 12 hours. The fligth to London was cancelled. There was only one person at the counter in Milan and no employee told any of the passengers about the flight cancellation. Customers were furious, screaming at the lonely representative, because British Airways was not giving any answers or solving the problem. My daughter missed her flight, was not offered a meal, a hotel room and only given the option to fly with Iberia through Madrid and then connect to Mexico City. Her bag was sent to a distant belt and was never told she had to pick it up and retrieve her luggage. This has been a total disaster. I had also paid for a good seat on her long flight to Mexico City, and now I will have to write and complain and wait for a refund.

Arriving at the airport I was told the flight was full but a change of seats might be possible once on board, which proved to be the case. But I then found myself next to a family with three very small children. Although the parents did what they could to amuse the children it was always going to difficult during a 13 hour flight. It was a long night and a very difficult flight. The sight of young children in nappies wandering around is not what I expected in business class.

✅ Verified Review |  Cannot believe how bad British Airways was. We arrived very early at the airport in Kuala Lumpur to catch a flight to London in premium economy. They would not allow us to check in online and we soon discovered why. The flight was massively overbooked. There are 39 seats in premium economy and they had overbooked by 10. There was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seats. This is utterly irresponsible. Very few people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancelling. We were told by the manager that this happens almost every night. Not a single employee of British Airways was there to manage the situation. It was left to the poor Malaysia Airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with it. They have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take 7 hours longer. They refused reasonable requests to give us an upgrade on the way home or to offer any other form of compensation. It is all very well for airlines to want to maximise profits but a good airline must care just a little for its passengers.

"Zurich to London Heathrow with British Airways. The lounge at Zurich was fine. Reasonable selection of food and booze albeit a shared lounge. Given the number of flights on this sector one wonders why BA could not have a small personalised set up. But we are talking about BA where nothing is ""normal"". Flight was rammed. I doubt if you could get a field mouse on the plane it was so full. The plane left 25 minutes late - but with a couple of gin and tonics on the way I could not care less. Seats, the usual cramped 3 into 2 configuration that is unique to BA regional business class. A lousy set up. FA's were very friendly and provided great customer service.

"✅ Verified Review | First class flight from London Gatwick to St Lucia with British Airways. First lounge at Gatwick was being refurbished but there was a temp replacement lounge offered by No.1 which was actually superior to to the old BA one. Flight left on time and arrived 15 minutes early which is always a pleasant surprise. The seats in first may not be quite as impressive as other airlines but they are still very comfortable and spacious. Inflight entertainment was very good with an excellent selection of movies. Two areas stood out on this flight - the first was the exceptional cabin crew who managed to pamper and constantly cater to your every need without being overbearing. Most importantly they all seemed genuinely motivated to make the experience on board a pleasant one. The next one (and I cannot believe I am saying this) was the food which was actually very good indeed and a stark contrast to previous flights in CW and First.

Flying in Club Europe from London City to Berlin Tegel, returning in economy with British Airways. The outbound flight was delayed for nearly 1 hour. However, the journey itself was very smooth and enjoyable. The food offered in the CE cabin was delicious. Flying back in economy was an absolute nightmare. Everything went wrong from checking in, lounge access, baggage claim and extremely poor service relating to my missing luggage. I had done my online check in on my return flight. Just went to the check in counter to drop off my luggage. The check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later I discovered had been incorrectly issued to me. She checked me in under someone else who happens to have the same last name as mine. After I dropped off my luggage, I went to the business lounge as I am a silver member. I provided the recepitionist my paper boarding pass and entrance was declined. Not surprising given the fact that they gave me the wrong boarding pass. However, I showed the receptionist my silver status on my mobile app. She didn't even look at it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her system. she didn't investigate anything and asked me to call up BA which I didn't bother. When I was queuing up at the passport control, I noticed the destination shown on my boarding pass was incorrect. I approached the BA staff at the gate immediately after I had cleared through security. BA staff were shocked that I was checked in under someone else's name. Wrong name, Wrong flight etc. They asked me to go to the correct gate immediately, but then they also told me my checked luggage was on the wrong flight and I might not have it back upon arrival at LCY. They gave me a new luggage tag. After arriving at LCY, waited for 20mins, bag didn't show up. I approached the baggage claim agent who was on her phone. I explained the situation which she didn't really pay attention and asked me to stand next to the conveyor belt, insisting my luggage would arrive. Again, no investigation, rushed service and a bit rude. 3 days later - no luggage still despite the fact that they have located my luggage.

"Flew economy class from Manchester to Johannesburg via London Heathrow with British Airways. Flight from Manchester to Heathrow delayed for over 2 hours, very crowded waiting area. We had paid extra for emergency exit seats chosen before departure (only available exactly 14 days before flight). This was well worth the money paid. The emergency exit seats meant we had no one sitting in front or either side of us, giving plenty of room to stretch out for an overnight flight. Again we had paid extra for upgraded meals and these were very good quality, well presented with proper cutlery, also served before the rest of the cabin enabling us to then stretch out and relax. Good entertainment system. All the advantages of premium economy without the price. We had the same service on the way back without the prebooked meals as these are only available from Heathrow. Dont know why it's not available both ways as the meal is basically what they serve in first class. Having used Virgin to fly to Jamaica for last 9 years are now going with BA into Kingston, hoping the service is as good. Only disappointment was with the return connecting flight to Manchester - again quite a long delay sat on tarmac with little explanation and a very rude attendant when my husband enquired about the delay.

"Club Europe flights from London Gatwick to Seville return. Outbound on 23/6/2016 return on 26/6/2016. Outbound flight was a victim of the French ATC strike and British Airways did their best to keep us informed about the status of the flight. They warned us that the lounge at Gatwick was closed and we used the No 1 lounge instead. Acceptable, but not of similar quality to the BA product we would have wished for. The outbound flight had a scheduled departure time of 15.25. Delayed 4 hours due to a combination of 1) French ATC strike (2 hours) 2) Blocked toilet on aircraft (20 minutes) 3) Change of seating configuration of the A320 that we were allocated (resulting in 13 economy passengers being bumped (45 minutes) 4) No ground crew to push us back from gate (remainder). Pilot and cabin crew did their best but were getting frustrated as were the passengers. Took off, reasonable inflight service outbound.

"✅ Verified Review | British Airways Lounge in T3 was very busy as shared with AA and others but good selection of nibbles and beers/spirits and more important to me it was clean and the staff were constantly clearing up after guests who had left. The boarding was a very far gate in the Satelite area of T3 and at around the same time we boarding to Vancouver a 747 was boarding to Las Vegas. So the area was very congested, the announcements of boarding were barely audible. The outward bound flight was uneventful (great) and as smooth a trip as I've ever had. Inbound was similar with just the annoyance of waiting for a stand at LHR for 40 minutes which spoilt a little the ending. The crew both ways were superb and professional.

"✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Rome via London with British Airways. Our flight from LAX to Rome was on time and generally good. We upgraded from Economy to Premium Economy at the airport for $382 each. We had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer points but could not because we booked through Costco (Costco said we needed to go thru BA and BA said we had to go thru Costco). Boarding was not well organized. Our flight from London was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing. One BA associate told us it would probably leave from gate 18 which proved to be incorrect information. We finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her iPad. We had to sprint back to gate 1 with 15 minutes until departure. When we arrived at that gate, we were told we would be bussed to our gate. We waited another 25 minutes for buses. Seats were fairly comfortable. Food was just okay - the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rock. We arrived in Rome almost 2 hours late. Coming home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good value. Our flight from Rome to London was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from Rome. Boarding was chaotic and you couldn't understand the announcements being made about who was to board and when. Other people were turned back rather rudely by BA staff. Everyone seemed confused. Snack on board was small but tasty. We had to be ""express serviced"" through security in London in order to catch our connecting flight. No time to catch a snack or use the toilet. Boarding was in-process when we arrived at the gate. Then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off. Seats were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat, the back of the seat was very close to your face. You had to ""go horizontal""in order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room. Arm rests between seats and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rests. Food was pretty good. On board entertainment was good. Service was slow, forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you. Our luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in London. We arrived 25 minutes late to LAX. I also take exception to the $90 luggage charge ""per leg of the trip"" for our 2nd bag. 1st bag is no charge but $380 (round trip) charge for the 2nd bag is very steep.

After having done this, and once our business travel plans were clear, we later booked a separate ticket using cash for a return from Edinburgh to London Heathrow. When we checked in at JNB, we were told we could not check our luggage through to EDI because the two sectors were on different (but still BA) tickets.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Newark return. Having just returned from my holiday, flying with British Airways in their World Traveller Plus class, I thought I would post my review. The week before we flew, we paid the £48 per person to select our seats so I had the comfort of knowing we would be sat together. We flew out of T5 at LHR one what I think is one of BA’s new 787 to Newark at 10.35am, and plane interior looked new and clean. We took our seats 21 J and K which were right next to the toilets. On our seats we found a small pillow, blanket, headphones and an amenity kit. I had plenty of leg room (ok, I am 5’5) and my partner had the entertainment box impacting his leg room but he seemed to be ok with it (he is 5’10). Although our seats were next to the toilets, we didn’t get disturbed movement or smells. Once the curtain was pulled between us and World Traveller, you wouldn’t have known we were by the bathrooms. We were offered a glass of something fizzy – water and juice were also available. Hot towels were handed out. Menus were handed out and main course was a choice of beef or chicken, with a pasta salad to start and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert, with cheese and biscuits. The food was ok, it was hot and tasted good. The food service was quick, and prior to the food served, drinks were handed out including a drink for the meal. However, during food service another drink was also offered. So, three small bottles of wine for the flight and I was well on my way to relaxing and starting my holiday. As we didn’t have anyone behind us, we could recline our seats without worrying about disturbing anyone. As there was a wall behind us, we couldn’t recline as far back as others, but it was comfortable enough. Luckily for both of us, the people in front of us didn’t really recline theirs too far. The seat was really comfortable, and even with my generous back side, I felt I had plenty of room. Although I had loaded up my tablet with films and books, I didn’t use it at all. Neither did I use the vast choice of IFE – I used to 6.5hour flight time to have some “me” time. My partner found plenty of choice and enough to watch during the flight. After food, the mood lighting was switched on and stayed that way until we were an hour from landing. Most people (me included) took the opportunity to have a bit of shut eye. A sandwich and small chocolate bar, tea and coffee was served and after a quick freshen up (in my seat). The pilot announced we would be landing and that the toilets would only be available for another 20 minutes or so. I quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up, but what was annoying was the number of people who decided to have almost a full make over in the toilets, spending 10 or more minutes in there – whilst the queue of people waiting to use the facilities grew longer. However, the toilets were clean. The landing was smooth and we arrived on time – I suppose you would say we were 20 minutes early, but don’t the airlines have that little trick of appearing to land early?

"✅ Verified Review |  We travelled on BA 633 from Athens on 12th of June, 2016. The flight departed at 7.55 pm but sat on the tarmac for 30 mins due to bad weather at London. Nonetheless, we only got in 15 minutes late. What went wrong from the very beginning was the check in process. We had showed up early but was refused check in at Club Europe. The ground attendant at Athens was incredibly rude and abrupt. If they had explained it to us nicely, we would have been fine with it. The result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a 767 – a larger than usual plane. When we finally lined up, it took a good 30 minutes and more to check in at Club Europe because for half that time, there was only one counter open. Eventually, a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she was pregnant (unheard of policy and she was perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up) and that was allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long line-up. Eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier Business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kind. Seating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had smaller spaces, and in fact were no more bigger than the economy class. The middle seats were fine as passengers there had the empty middle seat. British Airways were passing off economy seats as business but though the service was different – you couldn’t properly enjoy it. We were placed on the last row of Business class (14) and these were three seats stretching into the economy class cabin. It was so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our end. To be fair, I think other business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignments. Furthermore, when asked for a blanket, I was refused one on the basis there was none until I walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers there had blankets. How is this fair? What principle of seat assignment did they use? The last few BA trips to Europe have been nightmarish, from boarding processes (this one in Athens was chaotic and unsystematic, they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre-boarding process). We were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our Exec Club, the online check-in keeps breaking down and when we tell BA that, they tell us to call in (laugh out hysterically here). In fact the more frequent you are a flyer (but not high profile), the worse treatment you get. I also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different services were offered (later on, the Cabin director told me she could find a blanket for me but we were already 30 mins from landing). I cannot blame the crew, they work with what they get.

"✅ Verified Review |  I think that British Airways customer service must hold the accolade as the worst going, but that is their only achievement. Having booked our flight from Alicante to Gatwick I immediately selected and paid for seats in row 4 at a cost of €23 each. When I came to check in online, 24 hours before the flight, I found that we had been moved to row 30, the very back of the plane. When I selected 'Change your Seat' row 4 was not even displayed. I am 64 years old with back problems that make it quite difficult to struggle to the back of the plane. For this reason I am always more than happy to pay for seats near to the front and have never experienced any problem with other airlines I did not and have not received any notification from BA to tell me they had changed the seating. Nor have I received my money back. While waiting to board the plane I received a text message survey on my BA experience so far. I participated and gave a summary of the situation. I also agreed that they could contact me but still nobody did. When I got home I gave BA one day to contact me but when they did not I submitted a complaint through their website. After some days I got a reply saying: 'Would you like to claim a refund for your prepaid seating charge? We’ll be more than happy to see if you’re eligible if you complete the following form within 14 days of your flight'. I cannot think of another time where a supplier has taken my money, failed to deliver, and not informed me and automatically refunded my money. But with BA you have to 'claim' a refund and then wait while they 'check your eligibility'. My family take many flights each year including long hauls to Asia.

"✅ Verified Review |  At the beginning of the year I booked 4 first class seats London-Kansas USA for myself, husband, son and 84 year old mother to attend a wedding. At that time I also booked wheelchair assistance for my mother, she walks with a stick and cannot walk long distances. At check in they had no wheelchair and called for one. After some time when it did not arrive we were told it would be quicker to walk to security which we did with some great effort for mum. At security we were told the check in staff had not validated our tickets correctly so had to walk back again for them to do this and then walk back to security. Security itself was a nightmare despite the fact my mother had a doctors letter she had to stand with her hands raised in the body scanner and was then taken by two staff members to a side room as they wanted a more detailed search. When I complained the supervisor told me I would not be boarding the flight if I didn't keep quiet. Once this was completed we walked the long journey to the lounge and I requested again a chair to take my mother to the plane. It arrived but I was told I could not accompany her as they would transfer to a buggy and had to pick up other passengers so we went and boarded and said we would meet her there. The flight was being called for final passengers when my tearful mother finally arrived. The staff had taken her to the wrong gate and then told her if she did no want to miss the flight she would have to walk. On talking to the cabin crew they said this was not an uncommon occurrence. I had spent thousands on the flights, I had booked assistance and checked and re checked pre flight that there would be no issues but the staff just didn't care and saw mum as a nuisance. In the USA the service was brilliant and they never once through security asked my mum to get out of the wheelchair or stand in the body scanner and I was allowed to accompany her all the way. To add insult to injury on the flight back half the TV sets didn't work so they even had to do the safety talk manually and my husband never got his inflight dinner as after 2 hours and no sign of it he told them to forget it as he wanted to sleep. My mum refuses to fly BA again and if it wasn't for the fact that we have so many points and numerous flights already booked for myself, husband and children over the coming year we would transfer our business to Virgin and other carriers. I have complained to BA but as of yet no response.

"✅ Verified Review |  For those who have alluded to there being ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" on BA flights in terms of customer service I can assure them this is not the case. I am a gold executive club member and can confirm that I have invariably been treated with equal levels of contempt as a customer at all levels of their executive and club and most cabins. My last experience was with my wife flying from London Gatwick to Faro on the 18 May 2016. Checked in at the first counter for our economy flight to be told by the apparently gleeful BA employee that the plane was rammed so we knew we would be in for an uncomfortable flight. The lounges that are available whilst the BA lounges are renovated were packed and filthy. The BA lounge greeter offered no apology when we couldn’t access the clubrooms that were full. The flight was late and chaotic. A group of loud boisterous men, were virtually running the economy cabin, roaming the cabin whilst the seatbelt signs were on and raiding the galley to return with clutches of mini wines and spirits. This resulted in my Wife being told they had run out of gin and tonic. It turned out to be a lie when the Purser emerged from club to serve one of the other passengers with a G&T on a tray. Returned home 10 days later and complained. Received a jumbled response.

"British Airways have randomly cancelled a flight two weeks before departure from Athens to London that now means I miss a wedding that I booked 3 months ago.

Subsequently they have put me on a flight that now actually is impossible to connect from the island I am on.

"Las Vegas to London Heathrow return, and we did not have a good experience with British Airways. Both flights were incredibly hot and stuffy, unlike anything I've ever experienced flying on any other airline. I tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on planes, but I was uncomfortably hot the whole time. My husband and some of the other passengers sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it was. The staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. I definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline, and if you're a have not then don't even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. The people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. On our return flight, we asked about paying to upgrade our seats but were told it was a full flight and we wouldn't be able to because some passengers were receiving complimentary upgrades and others were being downgraded. I thought it was odd that they would be giving free upgrades if it meant downgrading passengers who had paid for better seats, but what was even more odd was that some passengers didn't know they'd been downgraded until they got on the plane! A group of passengers got on the plane and went to their seats only to find that they weren't the economy plus seats they'd paid for and reserved - they were regular coach seats. They had all the paperwork showing that they'd paid for economy plus, so this wasn't an error on their part. They were told it was a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted. A couple of passengers in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room. This poor old lady had to spend at least half the 10 hour flight standing in the aisle. The boarding process in Las Vegas was smooth, but boarding at Heathrow was a joke. The staff only made one announcement, and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible. As a result, no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong lines and basically all over the place. It made boarding take forever. The entertainment selection was sub par for such a long flight. A few decent movies but not much else. I thought the food was decent and they served plenty of food and drinks for the flight.",1,2016-06-15, United States ,False,la vega london heathrow return good experience british airway flight incredibly hot stuffy unlike anything ever experienced flying airline tend run cold usually need sweater plane uncomfortably hot whole time husband passenger sitting near also commented stuffy staff return flight rude passenger nice select definitely got impression either airline even bother expecting courtesy staff people sitting next complaint took hour staff member address return flight asked paying upgrade seat told full flight able passenger receiving complimentary upgrade others downgraded thought odd would giving free upgrade meant downgrading passenger paid better seat even odd passenger know downgraded got plane group passenger got plane went seat find economy plus seat paid reserved regular coach seat paperwork showing paid economy plus error part told full flight could get plane wanted couple passenger group elderly paid economy plus elderly lady group medical condition blood circulation needed extra leg room poor old lady spend least half hour flight standing aisle boarding process la vega smooth boarding heathrow joke staff made one announcement must speaker turned barely audible result one knew supposed go people standing wrong line basically place made boarding take forever entertainment selection sub par long flight decent movie much else thought food decent served plenty food drink flight

Bridgetown, Barbados is a small airport but the ground staff are very friendly and efficient and the Exec lounge is good with reasonable snacks given the time of day (mid-late afternoon) and a decent selection of drinks available. Aircraft was clean and it looked as if the Club World cabin had recently received some tlc. Entertainment system was excellent with a good choice of movies and very clear screen, no doubt part of the overall attention the cabin seemed to have been given. Bar service was good and the food was tasty, good portion sizes, the cheesecake for dessert was 'almost' too much. Being a night flight the crew got the bar and food service completed early in the flight allowing passengers to get some sleep before the lights came back up for breakfast. Breakfast was good. Cabin crew were excellent, friendly and efficient. Cockpit crew were clear and concise with their comms at the start and end of the trip.

"After my positive post of the outbound journey, the return from Philadelphia to London Heathrow reminded me how inconsistent British Airways has become. Before boarding was told just 5 F passengers, but actually the cabin was full, presumably upgrades, though supposedly no other cabin overbooked - this really does downgrade the experience for fare paying passengers. Good greeting, though CSD never did speak to passengers as far as I could see. Sleeper suits and amenity pack on seat before we boarded, rather than the usual personal offer to each passenger. Pre- departure warm champagne served and that was the last drink I was offered, other than a bottle of water, until breakfast. Did not eat as had been told that, since this is a Sleeper Service, I should eat on the ground. Very little crew presence in the cabin during the night, and I was awake for a good part of it.

"✅ Verified Review |  I would have been very disappointed indeed if I had paid a full fare for my business class ticket. The food was just appalling. I could hardly get two mouthfuls our of my starter and the main course (beef) was hard, tasteless and very small. Compared to business class meals in say Cathay Pacific or Qatar Airways, portions on both starter and main were around 50% less. Incredibly, British Airways serve such mean meals in business class on a transatlantic route, where they make most of their money, I was hungry after the meal so later on decided to 'raid the larder' but they only had sweet, which I generally avoid. The menu states there would be yoghurt and other stuff there they were not available. The FAs were embarrassed and got me some cheese.

The lounge was small but quite comfortable with a nice lady serving drinks at the bar. I asked her if she could make me a Rum Punch and despite causing a small queue, she happily made me an excellent cocktail. Boarding was well organised and the flight departed on time. On board we were extremely well looked - staff were very professional and were able to find the time to chat and make my wife and I feel very comfortable. The wine choices were explained very well with the offer of tasting each bottle. Dinner was plentiful if not that exciting but the numerous glasses of wine helped to make it was an enjoyable experience. We landed on time and after a brief scare from the pilot who said that due to the French air traffic controllers strike, there may be a delay in parking the plane, we soon disembarked and were in the luggage hall within around 25 minutes.

"✅ Verified Review |  We arrived at Gatwick just after 07.30 to catch the 10.00 flight to St Lucia. Check in was fine and although security was tight, we were airside just after 08.00. Before having breakfast we checked the flight information screen which indicated that the departure gate would be available at 09.00. After tea and toast we checked at 09.00 and the board indicated that the departure information would now be available 10.00. Obviously this was the first time that alarm bells start ringing as it was plain to see that we were going to be delayed. The on screen information then changed again to say that the departure details would be available at 11.00. At this point I did venture down to the British Airways information desk but as there was a queue of around fifteen people, I gave up and sat down again. At 12.00 the screen info finally said that we had a new departure time of 14.00. During all of this time I should add that at no time was any information (other than the screen) made available to passengers regarding the flight or details of refreshments etc. Despite numerous announcements from Easyjet and other airlines BA was conspicuous by its silence. We were eventually notified of the gate number and for the first time we were told as we entered the departure area the reason for the delay. Apparently there had been a problem with the cargo door and they had decided it needed to be replaced. Despite the rather cramped departure area, everyone seemed ready to board until we were told that the repairs were not complete and there would be a further delay and if some passengers wanted to stretch their legs they could leave their boarding passes with the ground staff and leave the departure area. Eventually we boarded just after 14.30. When everyone was settled in their seats the pilot apologised again and said the repairs still hadn't been completed and a further delay was likely. We eventually departed just after 15.30 after a delay of over five and a half hours. Now I know 'stuff' happens but let's not forget that we were departing from one of BA's home airports and why they couldn't have a second plane available quicker than five and a half hours is anybody's guess. Various people writing on online forums have previously spoken about the holiday routes from Gatwick being dumbed down by BA in favour of the traditional business routes flying out of Heathrow. I have no idea whether this is true or not but I would ask one question, if this flight had been a morning flight from Heathrow to JFK, would BA have found a solution quicker?

"A mediocre service on this airline flying from London Heathrow to Stuttgart, which was to be expected given my prior flights with them. Check-in process was fine at Heathrow. After security, I went to the first class lounge on the south side of Heathrow terminal 5. The lounge had no air conditioning and so was very hot as it was a fairly warm day outside - this made it quite uncomfortable. The hot food selection was poor - everything was very liquid based and looked unappetizing. There were a few bland sandwiches available as well. While the lounge itself is in a beautiful, large room, it is really let down by the lack of good food and service. Boarding process was seamless at the gate. The plane had been recently renovated but the seats were highly uncomfortable. There is very little legroom available and if you're taller than 5'11"", you're knees will likely be touching the seat in front of you. Food offering was very limited with only a small bag of chips on offer and one drink. Flight attendants were courteous but didn't really go beyond the minimum.

However, with only one agent on the desk dedicated to economy passengers (versus 3 agents for business passengers) BA bag-drop in Geneva was a slow and painful experience and slower than I have recently experienced with Easyjet in Geneva.  Boarding in Geneva was fairly smooth, no better or worse than Easyjet. In-flight Staff were friendly and efficient however the complimentary breakfast (of a ham and cheese croissant) could best be described as awful (a croissant in name only!). Given the price premium my overall opinion is that BA are not providing sufficiently better service in comparison to Easyjet considering the price premium between the two airlines.",3,2016-05-31, Switzerland ,False,review hiatus almost year heathrow inverness route reinstated may last year travelling inverness geneva using easyjet via gatwick thought would interesting see ba compare budget rival travelling north scotland overall would say particularly favourably bag drop checked online go bag drop however one agent desk dedicated economy passenger versus agent business passenger ba bag drop geneva slow painful experience slower recently experienced easyjet geneva boarding geneva fairly smooth better worse easyjet flight staff friendly efficient however complimentary breakfast ham cheese croissant could best described awful croissant name given price premium overall opinion ba providing sufficiently better service comparison easyjet considering price premium two airline
"✅ Verified Review |  Flew with British Airways on a 7 hour flight from Dubai to London in Economy with the tiniest TV screen I have seen in the last 10 years. It was so small you had to squint most of the time to make out what was going on, and the resolution was terrible and irritated the eyes. The screen had little crosses in it. This must have been an ancient plane. The movie selection was old given that I watched the same movies 2 months earlier. Nothing that is currently in the cinema. We only had one meal and when we asked for additional food there were only snacks in form of chocolate bars and biscuits. We were also not allowed to have any sparkling wine, which is ridiculous as they have it on tap in Business class. The staff seemed irritated most of the time especially the lady in Business class who welcomed us. Very disappointing experience.

Going against the grain somewhat I have to say that I truly prefer flying with British Airways over Emirates on the London Heathrow - Dubai route. Having tried both airlines several times I am definitely going to side with BA on this one. Firstly, BA offer some really competitive prices on this route. If you happen to have a few Avios tucked away then this flight can be a real steal. Secondly, out of LHR, BA really does have the best terminal. Okay, so Terminal 3 for Emirates isn't the worst terminal in the world but I much prefer Terminal 5. Spacious, light and with good dining options. As for the aircraft, well it's a choice between choosing the passenger pleaser that is the A380 or the retro classic that is the B747. I'll happily fly in either, although even after the refit the 747 is still showing it's age. As an economy passenger I have found the product on British Airways to be perfectly reasonable. The seat pitch is average, seat comfort is average, IFE screen size again is average. You get a choice of the latest blockbusters and a few other options. With Emirates you have a huge IFE, thousands of films to choose from and slightly better seat width and pitch. However, I've also wondered what the appeal is of choosing from thousands of films that I have no interest in watching. I'd rather just take my iPad preloaded with films I actually want to watch. The lack of WiFi isn't a huge concern for me. Hopefully the GoGo 2KU product BA is installing from 2017 will be more robust. Now for the catering. As an economy passenger I'm not expecting much but on the last few flights with BA I have been pleasantly surprised. The food has not only been edible but also really quite tasty. Where BA falls down is on presentation which is quite frankly awful. It's also the little extras that I notice. A pre-dinner drinks service. Coffee and tea offered throughout the cabin. Real cheese and crackers to finish off the meal (As opposed to soft cheese - I'm not 5 years old). With BA you also get a more substantial snack prior to landing. It's just a little tuck box but it is far more generous than the Emirates economy offering. I've found the crew to be hit and miss, in fairness, I've found that treating crew in the same friendly and warm manner as you expect to be treated normally brings out the best in them. The recent newspaper deal with the Murdoch empire is a nice touch. Along with the Daily Hate and 'i' newspapers to choose from you also get The Times, The Sun and Financial Times as complimentary options. Arrivals for BA at DXB is a bit of a nightmare. Terminal 1 immigration is something else and the journey from runway to stand can be epic. However, the new concourse D for departures is really nice. Not too blingy. Overall, a pleasant flight.

"I was very impressed with the World Traveller Plus experience on British Airways from London Heathrow to San Francisco. Obviously this is a very new aircraft for BA, but the seat and service experience really were very good and so much more pleasant than an economy flight. I had a window seat, so benefited from the extra space afforded by the location of the storage cabinets underneath the windows. The seat was very comfortable situated on the upper deck in the A380 which is a very quiet plane to travel in, and I enjoyed a couple of movies on the large screen with great sound via the supplied noise cancelling headset. The food was pretty good, and alcohol freely served. The only negative experience was being turned back from priority boarding at LHR even though I have Ruby status with BA. The ground agent was a little condescending in the way he handled it to be honest and of course I felt embarrassed in front of the other passengers, but the signage by the priority boarding lane clearly indicated that Ruby travelers had the benefit of priority boarding. I was a 10 year qualifying Gold Card holder on British Midland, but BA has chosen to not recognise all the frequent travelers who achieved this status over a decade of loyalty to the airline they bought claiming they had no lifetime member status in Executive Club, however I believe this is now something they do in fact offer. This is why I have reduced my score to 8/10, otherwise full marks.",1,2016-05-29, Philippines ,False,impressed world traveller plus experience british airway london heathrow san francisco obviously new aircraft ba seat service experience really good much pleasant economy flight window seat benefited extra space afforded location storage cabinet underneath window seat comfortable situated upper deck quiet plane travel enjoyed couple movie large screen great sound via supplied noise cancelling headset food pretty good alcohol freely served negative experience turned back priority boarding lhr even though ruby status ba ground agent little condescending way handled honest course felt embarrassed front passenger signage priority boarding lane clearly indicated ruby traveler benefit priority boarding year qualifying gold card holder british midland ba chosen recognise frequent traveler achieved status decade loyalty airline bought claiming lifetime member status executive club however believe something fact offer reduced score otherwise full mark
"Flew British Airways from Gatwick to Punta Cana. Where to begin? I'll start with the check in at Gatwick, having checked in online I was expecting a relatively simple baggage drop off, how wrong could I be. 4 desks servicing every flight, we arrived at the airport 4 hours before the scheduled departure time and spent 3 of these in the baggage drop off queue. Due to the slow service many passengers were getting called forward to jump the queue so as to not miss the flight. The staff on the desks looked thoroughly miserable and spent more time talking to each other than dealing with the customers. Security checks were surpsingly efficient but due to the time taken to drop off the bags we had no time to visit any shops and had to go straight to the gate, despite having arrived 4 hours early. Onboard the aircraft things improved a little, the food was good and the crew very attentive however the IFE is very dated on the Gatwick based 777s, my screen kept jumping every 3-4 seconds and stopped functioning completely an hour into the flight. The crew tried to reset the system but when it reset I no longer had the option to choose what to watch and could only watch the old style video loop. This wouldn't have been a problem for me if not for the fact that I paid an extra £38 on top of the ticket price to choose a seat. Overall a negative experience but I can't fault the cabin crew or the inflight service.",2,2016-05-27, United Kingdom ,False,flew british airway gatwick punta cana begin start check gatwick checked online expecting relatively simple baggage drop wrong could desk servicing every flight arrived airport hour scheduled departure time spent baggage drop queue due slow service many passenger getting called forward jump queue miss flight staff desk looked thoroughly miserable spent time talking dealing customer security check surpsingly efficient due time taken drop bag time visit shop go straight gate despite arrived hour early onboard aircraft thing improved little food good crew attentive however ife dated gatwick based screen kept jumping every second stopped functioning completely hour flight crew tried reset system reset longer option choose watch could watch old style video loop problem fact paid extra top ticket price choose seat overall negative experience fault cabin crew inflight service
"✅ Verified Review |  This was a flight from Gatwick to Bermuda on a 777 with British Airways. The aircraft was clean and reasonably comfortable, and the cabin crew were friendly and attentive. I am 6ft tall and normally have problems with the leg room offered in economy (Aer Lingus, I'm talking about you) but there was ample leg room. Indeed on walking through premium economy and club world on exiting the aircraft I didn't notice a big difference in leg room. I haven't flown BA for quite some years and had vague memories of the inflight meals being particularly shoddy. Not this time though. My meal was reasonably nice (chicken korma) and my fiancée had no complaints either with her pasta dish. The crew were round regularly with complementary soft drinks as well as snacks and glasses of water or pure orange. The IFE had a good selection, though one gripe is the positioning of the controls. There is a small controller built in to the top of the arm rest. This controller controls the IFE as well as your reading light and call button. More than once I accidentally pressed the light and the call button with my elbow while shifting position. A small gripe but it was quite annoying. Another gripe is the adverts you have to sit through when starting to watch a new selection. I was on continental and Virgin a couple of years ago and don't believe I had to sit through adverts before watching a movie or tv programme.

"Milan Malpensa to London Heathrow with British Airways. 1.25 hrs standing in queue to check in due to ""new system installed last month running slow"". So why no extra staff to cope with this? Plane then cancelled 30 mins after time, due to technical issue. No systems in place to cope with the size of what then needed to be done. Everyone had to re-claim baggage, exit via passport control and queue at service desk to re-book. Unbelievably, desk staffed by only one person. People with onward connections were being given priority so their journey could be re-planned but each of these took 10 to 15 mins to process, with a line of 100+ people waiting behind. Thus by the time one person had been served another had been prioritised to front of queue, meaning that the queue was effectively not moving. Over 3 hours later a third of the queue was still standing in line waiting to be processed. It was only the self-discipline of those in the queue that prevented this descending into total chaos. Why not two terminals so the onward travellers could be dealt with separately from those with simple needs? Why no seating and no queue management system? Pathetic response to what must be a an occasional problem. Then had to re-present to re-check-in again via their slow 'new system' and go again through security (mercifully top class) and passport control for evening flight.

"✅ Verified Review |  My partner and I were flying from London Heathrow to Bombay in March and were due to catch an onward flight to Goa. Unfortunately someone fell seriously ill on the flight and our plane was redirected to Istanbul to allow for them to be taken to a hospital. The redirection meant that we arrived in Bombay 3 hours late and wouldn't make our connecting flight. When we touched down in Bombay the flight attendants said that BA ground staff would help us with missed flights, connections etc, and we should speak with them when we disembarked. On this advice we sought out uniformed BA ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do. They advised us to exit the hall and find an airport-based travel agent and purchase new flights to Goa. When we voiced our concerns about not being reimbursed they reassured us saying that BA would definitely cover it, and went on to say that we should wait 14 days before making a claim through the website. Armed with this advice from BA staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets. Big mistake. Since returning home we have duly followed instructions and tried to claim for reimbursement. Here is the reply we received from BA customer relations: ""We've received a reply from Mumbai who've investigated your case. The agent you spoke to can't specifically remember speaking to you personally. He did mention he'd advised customers with separate tickets to make their own arrangements. He also mentioned BA wasn't responsible for any onward travel costs."" This is an outright lie.

Food and drinks were very good, we both had chosen the fillet steak for the main course and although cooked a bit longer than we would prefer was still moist and tasty. Wine and Champagne selection very good. Cabin crew were faultless, for example my wife asked for a Jasmine Tea and although this is not included in their selection the stewardess offered one of her one teabags!

"Milan Malpensa to London Heathrow with British Airways. My return flight did not start well. 45 minutes queing to check-in. After that though, the flight left on time and arrived a few minutes early. Thankfully there were seats by one of the overwing exits which were empty, so I was asked if I'd move forward. I was happy to do so. Like most European airlines, food is minimal; a small bun filled with chicken and bacon plus a dry cake with mocca flavoured icing. Exactly the same snack was provided on the outbound flight. I avoided alchol and stuck with an orange juice. The aircraft was an old ex BMI model (which I'd been on twice before), so it lacks the new seating, which is no bad thing. My checked bag arrived on the carousel 20 mins after landing (just as I got there), which was a bonus. All in all, an OK flight but I'd seek alternatives in future if the prices and timings were similar.",5,2016-05-18, United Kingdom ,False,milan malpensa london heathrow british airway return flight start well minute queing check though flight left time arrived minute early thankfully seat one overwing exit empty asked move forward happy like european airline food minimal small bun filled chicken bacon plus dry cake mocca flavoured icing exactly snack provided outbound flight avoided alchol stuck orange juice aircraft old ex bmi model twice lack new seating bad thing checked bag arrived carousel min landing got bonus ok flight seek alternative future price timing similar
"There are many negative reviews on this site - its almost embarrassing to admit to flying BA. I am adding another one. I have flown BA on/of for 37 years. I guess that makes me qualified to write a review. My main gripe is the total lack of value for money. The erosion of quality and services and the sky rocketing prices. This flight from Heathrow to Barcelona and the return - accentuates the lack of value. Barcelona flights operates out of Terminal 3 at LHR. Quite why BA use this ageing and outdated terminal is a mystery. You walk miles and if you are unfamiliar with this point, as we were, - you end up running a panicked race to the gate. Its worse on arrivals. Immigration and passport control was a zoo.  The T3 Business lounge is mediocre, Plastic tables and chairs. The most awful selection of dried out bacon baps and dried out omelettes stuffed into baguettes. The seating areas overlooking the airport was cluttered with newspapers. There was plenty of booze. Flight left on time. The meal inflight I could not be bothered with. FAs all fine. On the return the shared lounge was surprisingly good. More comfortable than T3 at LHR. Ageing plane. Mediocre afternoon tea. Frumpy FAs who ""forgot"" to hand out our Fast Track tickets to help speed up through immigration. (We got held up for half an hour.)  On both flights we had to endure the silly Club Europe seats - basically two seats - with the middle seat closed down into a table. Cramped leg room. Definitely no value here. I only fly BA when I have to. It really needs a clean out of the management and a new team with some vision on how to make British Airways a world leader - which right now they fail miserably to achieve, in all their cabins.",8,2016-05-18, United Kingdom ,False,many negative review site almost embarrassing admit flying ba adding another one flown ba year guess make qualified write review main gripe total lack value money erosion quality service sky rocketing price flight heathrow barcelona return accentuates lack value barcelona flight operates terminal lhr quite ba use ageing outdated terminal mystery walk mile unfamiliar point end running panicked race gate worse arrival immigration passport control zoo business lounge mediocre plastic table chair awful selection dried bacon bap dried omelette stuffed baguette seating area overlooking airport cluttered newspaper plenty booze flight left time meal inflight could bothered fa fine return shared lounge surprisingly good comfortable lhr ageing plane mediocre afternoon tea frumpy fa forgot hand fast track ticket help speed immigration got held half hour flight endure silly club europe seat basically two seat middle seat closed table cramped leg room definitely value fly ba really need clean management new team vision make british airway world leader right fail miserably achieve cabin

"Outbound flight with British Airways from Gatwick to Orlando was good, chose seats at the back of the aircraft and ended up with 9 seats (3 rows) between five of us, so we could stretch out and relax. Food was surprisingly good, served chicken curry with basmati rice for lunch and a chicken caesar salad sandwich for afternoon tea. Plenty of choice of drinks and snacks available throughout the flight in the rear galley. Inbound flight was less good. Took the cabin crew over three hours to do the drinks and dinner service, leaving less than 3 hours to get some sleep prior to breakfast being served. My son's children's meal took nearly two hours to arrive by which time he was starving. Dinner was chicken with dumplings which tasted a lot better than it looked. Breakfast was very poor, a small croissant with jam and a granola bar. The crew seemed stressed and disorganised for the entire flight. The AVOD system is starting to look dated compared with other carriers, there are a limited number of programmes to watch and the audio selection is very small.

"✅ Verified Review |  Family of 4 adults flying British Airways from Bangkok to London,and I wished I had done my homework first regarding aircraft type. The only outstanding experience on the flight was the service from the crew but that's where it stops. The seat was old, the footrest would not operate correctly. As a Oneworld Gold Frequent Flyer was able to get 1st row in Premium Economy. (2x2 by window). The pop up screen from the armrest would not stay in one position, the screen was cloudy and scratched making it impossible to watch the inflight entertainment so after an hour was put away. 12 hrs with no entertainment is a very long time. The food was probably the worst I've ever experienced, the main meal comes from the Business Class menu, not sure what happened in the galley but the steak was like concrete, could not be eaten, hence left behind (noticed other passengers did the same). Mid flight snack ok. Light Meal prior to landing was inedible, a lasagna that just the look of it put me off. Hence left behind. 12hrs 30min flight the catering is very average.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Newark. Two evenings prior to my flight I used British Airways Android app to reserve extended legroom seats for my wife and me. At the time, advance reservation of regular seats was $51 and $59 for front-section extended legroom seats. I had no interest in reserving a regular seat (I could wait until 24 hours before check-in for that) but I was interested in purchasing the extended legroom seats. So I paid the $118 for the two front-section seats. When my wife and I boarded the craft, lo and behold, the seats were not front-section seats at all! I was able to pull up the confirmation of purchase on my Android Phone and the cabin services director did his job very nicely, apologizing to us, offering us to file an incident report and reassuring us that all would be taken care of post-flight. However, subsequent to the flight, British Airways has been positively nasty in their response, claiming that we were given the seats for which our boarding passes were issued (true enough) and completely ignoring the point that they had misrepresented those seats as front-section when they were not. The fact that I received zero goods or services for my $118 beyond what I was already entitled to by my payment of the base fare means nothing to them. They have managed to bilk me out of $118 and having gotten their hands on my money, they intend to keep it. We'll see what my credit card company has to say about this, but it would be a lot smoother if we could simply settle this amicably, rather than forcing me to dispute the charge with my credit card company.

"Gatwick to Funchal. What has happened to BA club Europe? You used to get wider seats and more leg room than economy. Not any more. Same seats as economy but with middle seat blocked. Breakfast ok but not brilliant. Staff were good and I enjoyed the champagne but was it worth paying for club class? No it wasn't. We were lucky and got row 2 by the food galley which meant extra legroom but that was more luck than design. I wouldn't fly Club Europe again unless I was guaranteed this seat but to get it I would have to pay £18 per person each way on top of the club fares. Total rip off BA. Before we flew I was going to book British Airways to Bangkok. Based on this experience though I'll stick to EVA Air. Additionally the club lounge at Gatwick was dire. No seats available on arrival, cooked meal inedible and the lounge was not exclusive to BA and was clearly being used by all and sundry who paid a few quid for the use of a lounge.

Plane was 1hr late taking off (again) - checking at previous LHR-DEN flights revealed this has happened every day in May - so I was not too surprised we were late leaving. Premium Economy seat was ok but being close to galley was a bit annoying for the noise. IFE is so outdated now - tiny screen and very poor choice of music and only a few films worth watching. Food was so-so. The lunch 1st course was some sort of salmon salad and was ok, the main course was beef and it was very dry. Desert was a chocolate mousse which was lovely.

"✅ Verified Review |  British Airways have seriously gone downhill. There is absolutely no difference between them and low cost airlines - I would actually prefer easyjet and Ryanair as at least they are transparent. This journey from Lyon to London Heathrow was chaotic and stressful. Thanks to BA charging £30 to check in luggage one way, every passenger takes cabin baggage. This means everyone flocks to queue up like cattle well before any announcements are even made. The boarding process made more unpleasant by them calling different groups out - I have honestly never seen anything like it. Once on board, they had to stow a lot of luggage in the hold as it couldn't fit. Passengers were arguing with one another (3 separate fights were witnessed) and staff were being very aggressive shoving bags and coats in every nook and cranny and telling people to move. The meal service is a joke - a pathetic barely edible sandwich. As always with BA flights to and from LHR, this flight was late. We ended up flying round and round over London for 30 mins. The worst thing is BA's new policy of charging to select a seat - even at online check in opening 24 hours before. This means they assign you any rubbish seat and you have to pay £12 just to change it to any normal seat (and even more if extra legroom). BA's new policy seems to be to nickel and dime customers at every possible step of the way (and charge more than other airlines in the process). A shame they have turned this airline into something worse than low cost.

"Pisa to Chicago via London Heathrow. This route is one that I have done many times. Bought my ticket using British Airways miles and their part of the trip did not disappoint. The flight from Pisa to London Heathrow on an A320, was flawless. The check-in was normal, flight was fine, there were IFE and food and beverages served. I proceeded to my next flight, which was operated by American Airlines. Boarding was on time, which is the only positive thing about this flight. The seats are old, IFE had no selection of movies, when I searched for action and adventure there was only one film! How was I supposed to stay entertained on an 8 hour plus flight if there aren't any movies? The food was awful, and the best thing I can say is they gave lots of drinks. The food didn't sit well on the stomach, and trying to drink an alcoholic beverage just made it worse. I ordered a vegetarian meal, and was served a very bland and flavorless pasta. When breakfast was served I was given the same dish. The crew was careless and seemingly did not want to hear about my problems. There was no way to sit comfortably and I dreaded the flight since the moment my foot stepped aboard the plane. Arrived ahead of schedule, another positive thing. Once I cleared security I found that there is a British Airways flight, actually operated by British Airways, that arrives at the same time.

Flew British Airways business class from London Heathrow to Santorini. The seats are a joke and in reality are economy seats sold as a business class package. No leg room and BA attempt to improve the experience by blocking the middle seat for a 2x2 configuration (A/C and D/E). The problem is they use an upended tray which is bolted into the seat and cannot be moved. At least If the middle seat was vacant couples could stretch across and free up some much needed space. Our flight was delayed by a hour traveling out and so we were stuck in our seats for almost five hours. Flight was full in business (9 rows taken up) and quickly became stuffy.

"✅ Verified Review |  Berlin to Philadelphia via London Heathrow. I've traveled with British Airways many times, and always thought it was a decent airline and preferred it for my trips back to Philadelphia over some of the other airlines. However this last trip has changed my mind and I will no longer fly with BA. We were given misprinted tickets for our connecting flight in LHR which led to us missing our flight - despite showing our tickets to several BA employees. We rushed to the gate printed on our tickets, where the woman at the counter informed us our flight was departing from A10 the terminal where we had just come from. We had to run with all our carry-on luggage and winter clothing the distance the train normally takes you! Upon reaching A10, we saw it's actually sub-divided in sections: A10 a, b, c, etc. This caused even more confusion - at first it took us the wrong way. Of course when we finally found the correct gate the flight was already gone. The BA employee at the gate apologized and told us to require to be rebooked because ""the problem was the fault of his colleague"". At the customer service counter, they also admitted the mistake, and pointed it out to a colleague who also agreed they had never seen this kind of error before. Another woman in line behind us, had the same issue and missed the same flight for the same reason. The customer service woman did her best for us and gave us new tickets but for a much later flight, and advised us write you in order to ""follow it up"". When we did try to ""follow it up"" I was sent a response that was clearly cut and pasted with errors and typos and did not address the issue of my complaint. I tried to call a few times to speak to an agent in person, but ended up waiting for close to an hour and having to pay several euros. Customer service was terrible and I can't imagine how it would have been if there was a more serious issue. Aside from this, the flights were cramped and the entertainment system was outdated - small screen with a poor selection and you have to hit your finger hard against the screen to get it to work. Not to mention, the beginning of our flight (way back) until after the food was served the system was out-of-order. The last complaint is about the airline food. As a vegetarian, normally I like BAs food but this time it was a joke. My ""special"" meal consisted of considerably less food than my boyfriend who had the regular meal. The pasta was one of the worst I've had on flight, and when breakfast came around, I got a recycled fruit cup from my dinner, while everyone else received a full box of food!

"Completely unimpressed with British Airways. They lost my luggage on a  flight from Dublin to London. When I informed them, they did not apologise but assured me I would have my bag by that afternoon. I was lucky my air BnB provided me with a towel and toiletries. I had not heard from them by 6pm and was told to wait until they contacted me. I then got a message at 8pm at night to say they had found my bag and the courier was picking it up at 10pm and then it would be delivered. So I specifically stayed home that night And finally decided at midnight they were not going to deliver it so went to sleep. I woke up and called British Airways at 9am to ask when it was going to arrive and where was it as I got a message saying it was being picked up at 10pm the night before so had stayed home. They said to call the courier company. I then called the courier company and they said that it was a mistake and they would never deliver a bag that Late at night. They then said the driver had a late night so wouldn't arrive until lunch time that day. so I went out for the morning and returned to my apartment at lunch. I then received a message at lunch time that said they would actually not arrive until sometime between 3 and 5pm that afternoon. I called to see if I could get a more specific time or they could tell me when they were on the way.

The main issues were lack of clarity at the airport as to what the issue was, last-minute confirmation of offloading (which left us short of time to take another flight), a poor process for transferring airports (I had to bus from Gatwick to Heathrow), and poor follow-up when I queried matters afterwards. BA refused to state whether staff or standby passengers had been prioritised, repeatedly citing privacy. I checked with a friend who's a UK privacy legal specialist, and this applies to individuals but not to categories such as staff or standby, so it appears to be a refusal by BA to respond. I also raised the transfer with BA, as this involved further queueing to turn a voucher into a ticket, which meant I missed a transfer bus. Better to issue a ticket, or a voucher that can be used on any service that day, with BA to arrange it so with the bus company. On the positive side, I was compensated per the rules, and did make a BA flight later that day, which was OK. Nonetheless, this could have been handled much more smoothly, and I'm afraid British Airways customer service on the ground and in follow-up let them down.",7,2016-05-04, New Zealand ,False,london gatwick amsterdam bumped british airway flight result change plane gather process well handled appeared staff standby passenger given priority although others also missed understand main issue lack clarity airport issue last minute confirmation offloading left u short time take another flight poor process transferring airport bus gatwick heathrow poor follow queried matter afterwards ba refused state whether staff standby passenger prioritised repeatedly citing privacy checked friend uk privacy legal specialist applies individual category staff standby appears refusal ba respond also raised transfer ba involved queueing turn voucher ticket meant missed transfer bus better issue ticket voucher used service day ba arrange bus company positive side compensated per rule make ba flight later day ok nonetheless could handled much smoothly afraid british airway customer service ground follow let
"Flew Toronto to London in British Airways club world on avios and companion voucher. Prompt check in at Pearson with friendly staff. The club lounge is well run with dinner served as this is a sleeper service. A good choice of food though though the wine list remains unimaginative. The lounge is too small when busy. Additional toilets are needed - too few with queues before the flight was called. Friendly staff on the flight with lights out after takeoff and a tray service offered. The dessert and cheese and drinks was perfect before an ok sleep. The flight is too short for a decent sleep and the club world layout is now dated and in a real need of a re-think. Once cutting edge, it's not fun being stepped over by a stranger and there is a real lack of privacy. Breakfast was ok with the hot muffin being a confused offereing. Returning from Heathrow 10 days later started with a very slow check in process - unusual for T5 with agents blaming cancellations from the previous day spilling over. Went straight to the club lounge on the B gates which is a hidden gem - quiet, well stocked, few children and in good condition. Pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to first on arrival in the lounge . A superb flight with BA first at it's best. Decent vintage champagne before take off, friendly, engaging and professional crew made the experience really first class - impressive given the cabin was full. Great Rose Champagne, an excellent wine list - especially the reds, and well cooked food. A movie, afternoon tea and we arrived head of time into Toronto. The bags almost beat us off. BA can be variable in service - especially in Club World and some of the cost cutting in recent years - though these return flights reminded me of the old BA and how good it can be at its best.",8,2016-05-04, Canada ,False,flew toronto london british airway club world avios companion voucher prompt check pearson friendly staff club lounge well run dinner served sleeper service good choice food though though wine list remains unimaginative lounge small busy additional toilet needed queue flight called friendly staff flight light takeoff tray service offered dessert cheese drink perfect ok sleep flight short decent sleep club world layout dated real need think cutting edge fun stepped stranger real lack privacy breakfast ok hot muffin confused offereing returning heathrow day later started slow check process unusual agent blaming cancellation previous day spilling went straight club lounge b gate hidden gem quiet well stocked child good condition pleasantly surprised upgraded first arrival lounge superb flight ba first best decent vintage champagne take friendly engaging professional crew made experience really first class impressive given cabin full great rose champagne excellent wine list especially red well cooked food movie afternoon tea arrived head time toronto bag almost beat u ba variable service especially club world cost cutting recent year though return flight reminded old ba good best
"✅ Verified Review |  Accra to London Heathrow. Sadly British Airways has gone downhill. To start, the plane was dirty, excessive hand luggage allowances meant delays to boarding, the food was awful, leg room was non existent (I'm only 5'6), subzero temperatures during the flight and an inadequate ratio of toilets to passengers left me very uncomfortable. The positives were that staff were friendly and courteous under difficult circumstances and they didn't bother forcing us to endure the safety walk through. For a 6 hour direct flight at just over £500 this was the cheapest I could find. Provided you eat before you fly, restrict your water intake, wrap up very warm and take your own tablet/ereader then it will be fine.

An adequate if small movie selection, service with a smile. Best economy class flight I've had for years. It's great to see that BA can still do it very well and provide such an experience.

Our stroller was delivered at the gate and with a stroller there was a special bus to transfer us to the other terminal. We did not have to pass security a second time, so we arrived very soon in a crowded business lounge. As a gold member I checked the First lounge, but ground staff did not welcome me because it was crowded too. We found a quiet ""dinner part"" of the business lounge, were seated by a very nice ground staff who offered me a glass of champagne to relax. Food was decent. Boarding the upper deck of this Boeing 747-400 was a pleasure with a CSD welcoming us by name. Flight was excellent: food amazing, enough cold drinks were offered, cabin crew looking after us and our baby. Our baby was playing all the time, singing and talking his own words. After this perfect flight, transit in LHR terminal was again relaxing. Stroller was again waiting for us at the gate, very nice. After security we went to the first lounge which was really was crowded, but we found a quiet place to sit. Time for a shower, breakfast and relax.

"London to Calgary return with British Airways, and we fly this route about twice a year, and in the past have flown in the 767s which were rather aged but homely! This time, we had the experience of the new Boeing 787 which was very nice and new, and we found the seats just as comfortable, particularily in Premium Economy. What we did not enjoy was the change in attitude from the staff, they seemed so different to the crews we had looking after us on the previous runs. The emphasis was on getting things served as fast as they can, and woe betide you if you want extra milk for your cup of coffee! The food was good, and we felt safe and efficiently cared for, but there was not the fun around that we used to encounter when wandering around in the small hours of the flight, when you could go to the galley and get a coffee or a snack. After all this is a long haul flight, and I can well understand the rush on a short haul flight. The person behind us was air sick, which was not their fault, and the cabin crew dealt with this well. Our return flight was better, and we enjoyed the glass of fizzy prior to take off, which is a nice touch, and is something that other airlines do in Premium Economy. I think that BA managers should travel with other airlines to review its premium economy brand. Finally, I think the breakfast is not very nice, and could be improved upon.

"Using an Avios redemption ticket we travelled out to Toronto in First Class with British Airways and the experience was superb. We checked in in London and the lady that checked us in was warm and friendly. The Concorde Lounge was good and we had a tasty table service breakfast before retiring to the sofa area to relax. The lounge is very comfortable and relaxing. Boarding was on time and we were met at the door and escorted to our seat. Immediately offered a glass of champagne and the service continued until landing. Lunch was very good, and served with style and attention to detail. The two cabin crew that took care of us were superb and the perfect combination of professional and chatty. Afternoon tea was perfect for this length and time of flight and we disembarked to find our bags first off the carousel in Toronto. All in all a great flight. The return flight was in Club World on the Upper deck of an ageing but lovable and well cared for 747, and was almost as good. The lounge in Toronto was small but comfortable and we dined before the flight where a good buffet was served with to order Pad Thai available. Upon boarding we were greeted by the most delightful crew members who personally introduced themselves and who clearly loved what they were doing. Individual and personal service was the order of the day and even though I did not eat, I was asked numerous times if I needed anything and felt very cared for.

Each course was tasty and well presented. The crew took the time to describe each course as it was being served and continually topped up the wine.

"✅ Verified Review |  Vancouver to Barcelona via Heathrow with British Airways. I would like to start this review by stating that the only reviews I've taken time to write in my life were positive ones, choosing to ignore negativity. This however will sadly be my first negative review and even sadder to say that I'm taking time to write this before we've even completed our round trip with British Airways, to be more direct I'm writing this on our final connector flight to Barcelona. On February 24th, 2016 I purchased a round trip with cancellation flight from Vancouver, Canada to Barcelona, Spain. This was a surprise for fiance for her 30th birthday as well as our 1 year engagement anniversary. Naturally we counted down the days in excitement booking ourselves an apartment and scheduling reservations for dinner as well as tickets to a Barcelona FC match. Even setting up scheduling for grandparents on each side for our 9 month old daughter.  April 16th, 1 day before our trip I receive a email labeled ""updated travel itinerary."" When I opened the email, our flights no longer included our flight from Vancouver to Barcelona, actually they only had a return flight from Barcelona on April 27th. As I had got home late on April 16th from Cuba, I couldn't contact anyone until early morning of April 17th (my Fiance's birthday). Convinced it was just a mistake we thought nothing of it. Upon calling in the morning we were informed that our flight had been ""cancelled"". We tried everything we could to make any flight happen that day but were told there was only 1 seat remaining and that my fiance could fly out on the 17th and I follow on the 18th, which as an engaged couple makes no sense. We decided to look past this and try to seek reimbursement for the apartments fees and other things that we were now out of money on due to arriving a day late. This began a huge run around of my fiance trying to submit their online form 3 separate times only for the screen to read ""submitting"" for roughly 30-60 minutes each time, never one actually submitting. We decide again to overlook this and deal with it at the check in counter at YVR. The agent we were speaking to was a very nice lady who went above and beyond to figure out what happened to our flight the previous day as it left as originally scheduled without us on it. She put a note on our file that an agent from Jacksonville BA had cancelled our flights for no apparent reason. We asked for an upgrade on our seats, that wasn't available to us. We asked for access to the BA lounge while we waited, we were told that was full even though we walked past an empty lounge on the way to our flight. After a very uncomfortable flight to Heathrow we spoke to an agent there, who again was helpful in pulling up our file notes and sending a email to get the ball rolling for us on the reimbursement process (which we still have to wait for a reply before we can go ahead trying to recoup slome of our losses, which unfortunately still wouldn't get us the day we missed back). She went the extra step to grant us access to the lounge while waiting and moved our seats up a few rows. That was a breath of fresh air until we realized that we had been moved to the row right behind the curtains. While we snacked on a 1/4 of a sandwich portion of food we could hear the plated dishes on the other side of the curtains and good food people were eating all the while staring at minimum 4 empty seats.

"Doha to London via Bahrain with British Airways, and a very poor lounge in Doha. Even flying First Class on BA there is no reciprocal arrangement to access the excellent Qatar Airways Lounge. Instead there is a lounge for all other airlines. On boarding my wife and I were ushered to our seats. And to our amazement our individual lockers were opened by the flight attendants who promptly disappeared without making an offer to hang our coats or jackets, as is standard practice on even business class. No hot towels before take off or landing, very average menu, and as we slept through dinner were keen on breakfast. Told that due to possible turbulence coffee could not be prepared, both our cutlery earlier wrapped by the crew were delivered without spoons to eat the very soggy muesli. Orange juice tropics a quality. We had to ask for marmalade with our toast. All the crew displayed little perception of customer needs, made the more marked by Qatar Airways Business class crew who were absolutely excellent on the earlier Sydney to Doha Flight. Poor food, very poor crew awareness, or attention to detail, who seemed to be going through the motions. Slightly aloof. Way below the 3 Gulf majors in flight attention.

"London to Johannesburg, and I decided this time to fly with British Airways given they fly there with the A380. I was quite looking forward to the experience of flying Business Class on the upper deck of the A380. I needn't have bothered. Following an uneventful few hours in the Galleries Lounge it was time to board, straight onto the upper-deck. My business colleagues before me passed through the gate without problem, however I was told to wait a moment as there was an issue with my boarding card - ""just a moment sir, oh it looks like you've been approved for an upgrade to First which is on the lower deck - no, sorry, my mistake - you're still in Business upstairs but I'm afraid we've had to move you from your selected seat"" (the one I'd paid the not inconsiderable sum of £80 to reserve in advance by the way) - but not to worry, it's still a window seat"". Except it wasn't - it was seat 50A, a windowless seat next to the toilets. The journey itself was uneventful. The food a bit of a disappointment without any flavour, my beef main was dry and rather tasteless. The wine was very good. Entertainment system not bad, though not a patch on the likes of Emirates. The staff friendly and efficient enough and I managed to sleep a few hours. I wrote to BA to complain about my change of seat and the unprofessionalism of telling someone they had an upgrade when they hadn’t. I had to chase up twice for a reply. The one I eventually got was pitiful and as impersonal as could be with a stock answer about the need for them to occasionally change people’s seats for operational needs The biggest issue for me with BA’s Club World however is its ridiculous layout whereby people have to step over each other’s legs - I don’t know of any other business class product which has this and it leaves BA well behind the competition. Although not my favourite airline, BA could do worse than take a note of their partners Iberia which has a staggered layout but offers direct aisle access to all. The situation whereby you find yourself starring at strangers until one of you decides to raise the privacy screen is also far from ideal and surely not safe as the cabin crew have to constantly lower it to pass hot food and drinks over your neighbour. Can’t help but think that BA have missed a real opportunity to shake things up with their new fleet of A380s. Whilst some airlines have been creative and had on-board bars, lounges and showers, BA has just packed in as many seats as possible – there are 7 abreast in Club World upstairs and 8 Downstairs which is staggering and an insult when paying premium prices. I should have known better having flown on one of BA’s other new additions to its fleet last year, a Boeing 787 to Toronto, which also was extremely claustrophobic. I returned home from South Africa upstairs on a Boeing 747 from Cape Town to London. The plane might have been older but the experience altogether more pleasant. This journey ironically took me up to Silver Membership, I won't be choosing to fly long-haul with BA again however, unless I have to.

"✅ Verified Review |  I am writing to complain about my deeply distressing British Airways flight from London Heathrow - Cape town with a change at Johannesburg. The flight was badly managed throughout. when I arrived at Heathrow, I was told by a member of staff that my name was not on the system. She eventually found it, She then said 'oh Im sorry to tell you that there are no more seats on the flight.' I was obviously distressed by this as imagined I would have to return back to Dorset? However, after much insisting she eventually eventually found my seat. I arrived at the gate in good time for my flight to Johannesburg. However we were all waiting for about a further half an hour past the time we were meant to have departed the airport. In this time, there were no explanations as to why we were so late boarding the plane. Once on the plane, again we waited and waited and waited - and eventually we were told that 'Sorry for the inconvenience, but BA did not have enough time to the the engineering works, or refuel or do the mandatory paper work for this plane during the day.' So we were extremely late in setting off from Heathrow. I think this is a poor excuse for not departing at the correct time and we were not given enough notifications throughout the lengthy wait. I was concerned about catching my next flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town. The flight attendant told me not to worry and there will be lots of BA ground staff to help us all when we arrive at Johannesburg. However, this could not have been further from the truth. Once landed there were no British Airways staff present - except for one lady in a High Vis jacket who explained to people that needed to get the connecting flight to Johannesburg to leave their luggage as it would be put on the plane and to Run to the next gate for the flight. She then pointed at a man (he was wearing no uniform) saying he will take me and another passenger to gate. We literally ran through the airport and then the man asked for a tip? I gave him £5 but was extremely suprised that I would have to 'tip' someone who supposedly BA advised me to go withOnce getting to the gate and (just in time) the lady at Comair said radioed through and told us they had already sold our tickets, and rudely shouted at me as to 'Why? did you leave your luggage' By this point I had tears falling and was feeling extremely overwhelmed. She then told us to 'just go back' with no further help. Luckily another passenger was with me and was kind enough to show me the BA check in desk to ask for new tickets to Cape Town. Once at the BA deskthey were not helpful in the slightest. They simply told me to go and get my luggage from a 'Menzies' which was the other side of the airport and see if it was there. I ran too and fro the Menzies (lost luggage) to the Comair and BA office - back and forth for around 2 hours. No staff were helpful even though I was crying and feeling completely bewildered.

"Manchester to Los Angeles via Heathrow with British Airways.

It transpires we have to contact BA ourselves to get our money back after filling in a form. This sums up British Airways now, as an airline where customers are effectively charged for something they aren't provided with and then BA making it so difficult that they hope they get to keep the money, customer service is non existent. Other than this, all 4 flights we took were late, our son was given child meals we hadn't booked, the choice of meals was one of only two options both were disgusting, one of the seats was broke on a new A380 and the seats were incredibly uncomfortable in that you could feel the metal frame as there is no padding in the seats.

"✅ Verified Review |  This was my second time flying with British Airways and this particular route from Vancouver to Paris CDG via London Heathrow. Round trip was overall on time without delay. Online check in was easy and got to pick out the seats I wanted. Picked up the boarding passes at the airport without any problems. The food was above average and the cabin crew were courteous and professional. Drinks were frequently served or could be picked up from the galley independently. Washrooms were clean. Overall a satisfactory experience. However, one thing almost all travellers on the YVR-LHR route will notice is the age of this aircraft. I think it should be replaced soon, since this is a very popular route. I flew in late March and return beginning of April, being low season but the cabin was still full. I think this flight deserves a newer aircraft like the A380. Particularly, the back of the seats are very thin and one can feel every scratching movement if the person behind tries to retrieve items from the front pocket.

And Premium Economy offers just enough space to move out if needed.

As someone travelling with us is registered blind we could reserve seats before others on both flights with ease, priority boarding was given as well. Online check in was smooth and boarding passes on the outbound were printed off. On our flight out to Athens we were given a choice of a hot or cold meal. As I had something to eat before; I passed, but this was great given that some people would have been transiting quickly and wouldn't have time to eat at the terminal.

"✅ Verified Review |  British Airways used to be better than this. I spent all afternoon in the Business lounge, waiting for my Gatwick flight at 7pm. My boarding card said the gate closed at 1840, and when I hadn't heard any announcement by 1830 I asked the BA man at reception if there was a delay. I was very dismayed when he casually said ""yes, about 1 hour 30 mins"". I was very unhappy they had not told us earlier, or asked if we needed help getting home in a more timely manner. There was a time when BA would have tried to reroute its premium passengers, but this man told me his duty manager had specifically told him not to do this. He told me that if I wanted to switch to an earlier LHR or LCY flight I would have to go back landside and buy a ticket for those flights. Onboard I had my first experience of BA's new club Europe, wherein the middle seat is covered by a tray, to give the perception of more space, without actually giving you a wider seat or more legroom. From my experiences of BA business class in both long and short haul, over the past year, it is very sad to see that BA is focussing on making changes which make it more money, rather than changes which benefit the passenger experience. My meal was plonked down in front of me without telling me what it was, and it wasn't at all tasty.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Rome Fiumicino.

As I was flying from Gatwick, the BA lounge was under refurbishment and was directed into No 1. lounge which was quite packed already. When I got to Rome, my baggage was lost. To make matters worse, the counter for lost baggage which operates on behalf of British Airways was very poorly marked. There was no sign or logo of British Airways. It was manned by two person which hadn't had a clue what was going on and would only assist in filling up the forms.

"Miami to Manchester via London Heathrow with British Airways. The aircraft was very old and dated, and too hot with no airconditioning above the seat. Food was disgusting - some type of chicken mashed up with potato and peas. These 747 aircraft need to be updated or retired as they are now showing their age. Tv screens are so small and have no USB or power points. Outbound flight was with American Airlines that was so much better. New aircraft, good entertainment and food with was good. Now that you have to change terminals at LHR when connecting from Miami, there is no advange of flying BA. So if you can choose a different airline or if you have to fly BA, avoid the 747.

"British Airways in my mind is fast approaching a national tragedy. As one who has flown them on/off for 35 years I suggest I am qualified to have a view - having travelled in all cabins including Concorde. We flew Club Europe from London Heathrow to Pisa and back this last week over the Easter break. We have a home in Italy and fly the route often. Flight out started in the North Executive lounge at LHR. It was not busy and was OK. Terrible choice of unhealthy bacon baps and similar rolls stuffed with whatever. I had some fruit - tinned fruit. Plane was a newish plane and the so called ""new"" Club Europe. Three seats - with the middle one as a ""table"". Tables are usually in front of one - not to the side. Zero legroom unless you are in row ""1"". Last month I flew the regional Business Class on Singapore Airlines, Malaysian Airlines and Vietnam Airlines. Needless to say - British Airways does not come close when it comes to seat comfort. Disgraceful. Food okay on both flights. FAs on both flights were also fine. The curtain separating the Club cabin from Economy was broken, hence we had queues for the WC stretching into the Club cabin.Its long overdue - but BA need some serious management changes to build value into their key products.",8,2016-03-31, United Kingdom ,False,british airway mind fast approaching national tragedy one flown year suggest qualified view travelled cabin including concorde flew club europe london heathrow pisa back last week easter break home italy fly route often flight started north executive lounge lhr busy ok terrible choice unhealthy bacon bap similar roll stuffed whatever fruit tinned fruit plane newish plane called new club europe three seat middle one table table usually front one side zero legroom unless row last month flew regional business class singapore airline malaysian airline vietnam airline needle say british airway come close come seat comfort disgraceful food okay flight fa flight also fine curtain separating club cabin economy broken hence queue wc stretching club cabin long overdue ba need serious management change build value key product

"✅ Verified Review |  Istanbul to London Heathrow with British Airways. The main reason I pay to travel Business Class is to get extra leg room. BA's Club Europe now gives you exactly the same leg room as in Economy, which may be okay for a quick hop to Paris, but is definitely unsatisfactory on this near four hour flight. It was particularly annoying to see children sitting in row 1 - the only row with reasonable leg room. Service was fine and the food quite good, but no entertainment at all. From now on I'll book Economy and pay for exit seats - it's a no-brainer. Either that or fly Turkish Airlines, an airline which is going from strength to strength.

"✅ Verified Review |  British Airways from Seattle to Johannesburg via London Heathrow. First leg SEA to LHR was on a 747. The plane was satisfactory to me. I don't understand the comments from people who think the 747 is tired or worn out. Not a bad ride in economy when the person in front of you doesn't recline their seat. I sat in one of the ""twosomes"" (seat 52A) in the tail. The food on this leg was bland, the continental breakfast was a disappointment. I would buy seat 52A again if I was traveling on a British Airways 747, but be advised there is no wall next to 52A that you can lean on to sleep. Second leg was on an A380. I sat in the tail of the upper deck in seat 82A. This time, the young woman in front of me reclined to the maximum as soon as she could and kept her seat that way the entire 11+ hours of the flight. The A380 is a very nice plane and the overall experience was pleasant despite extensive turbulence the majority of the way. The upper cabin on an A380 is amazingly quiet. The food on this leg was far better with an English breakfast served prior to landing in Jo-burg. I would not play for seat 82A again because there are two boxes under the seat in front of 82A that limit foot room, but I would play for seat 82B, which is an aisle seat. IFE on both legs was pretty sad but I'm not one for popular culture. Cabin attendants on both legs were polite and did a very nice job. BA ground personnel at Heathrow were very nice and helpful. I've traveled between South Africa and North America about a dozen times over the past two years.

The IFE was good and the 2 hot meals served quite tasty and filling. In addition, the cabin crew were again excellent.

"We flew British Airways from Gatwick to Punta Cana in economy and flew back in Premium economy. Was it worth it? Well we didn't pay too much more, so probably overall yes - just about. But other than slightly more legroom you don't get much! Same food as economy as far as I could tell. Main meal was nice. Breakfast was not good enough for an airline of this supposed calibre - small cold cheese croissant and muesli bar! Only one tea/coffee round and then they whipped round to collect the empties. We got to board before the economy passengers but that's no big deal. We had to pay extra to secure seats at the side in a pair. Otherwise, we would have had to sit in a block of 4 in the middle which we don't like. I begrudged paying the extra for this to be honest. Captain was cheery and informative, and apologised endlessly for the short delay leaving Punta Cana. Crew were polite but not friendly. Ours was an older guy who had an air of 'I've been doing this a long time and I'm pretty fed up with passengers'.

"My first long haul flight with British Airways for some years and what a mistake! I flew Premium Economy expecting it to be on par with its competitors especially Lufthansa or Virgin Atlantic - not so at all. At the airport, it took over 1 hour to check-in; there was no dedicated premium economy check in nor a premium economy boarding queue at the gate either; perhaps the plane would be a little special? No, not at all, it was an old Boeing 777 that had been designed to maximise seats at the expense of comfort; the cramped space of the premium economy cabin with its 2-4-2 seating was comparable to economy and was light years behind the modern and spaciousness of other airlines, and sitting in a middle row seat meant you could not physically squeeze past the person next to you to the aisle unless you woke the person up or you took your chance to stand over them and hope you manoeuvred successfully. Stupidly I had thought that competition would eliminate most differences between airlines. How wrong I was - avoid British Airways on the Hong Kong route if you are flying on a Boeing 777.

"Sydney to London Heathrow via Singapore, and our first foray into British Airways Business Class (Club World) was not a success.

"British Airways flight from London to Singapore on January 30th was perfect, a superb crew, helpful and chatty without being obtrusive. Cabin was comfortable, amenities, pyjamas etc of good quality. Food was rather dull, and not well prepared, perhaps 5-spice duck is not the best for an airline cabin. Wines and spirits were of good quality, and we arrived on time and in good shape. De-planing was efficient, and as expected in Singapore Changi, everything functioned well. The return flight  on March 3rd was not so good. The crew were sleepy and not particularly communicative; you had to ask for everything, even the meal schedule, and it took ages for dirty crockery to be cleared up. The flight arrived early, which was good, but as usual, Terminal 5 was still asleep, inefficient and ineffectual. We did not use the usual immigration channel, but it looked chaotic, as was the baggage re-claim nowadays.

"Flight from Heathrow to Chicago  delayed over three hours, with a litany of excuses for Boeing 747-400 going tech, faulty smoke alarm in toilet, catering truck damaged fuselage door, engineers couldn't correct fault.

BA First Class seat is a very, very poor product, and entertainment screen slow. IAD-LHR return on the A380 in First Class. The A380 is a wonderful aircraft, woefully let down by the poor BA First Class seats and service, the seats are barely Business Class by modern standards, and the dinner service was inelegant and almost inedible. Crew on return were impersonal, and keen to get the dinner service over. Finally, BA Customer Relations (based in India) responded to the 3+ hours delay by declining my claim with an insincere form letter. They also don't appear to have a good grasp of English. Overall, the end-to-end experience with BA was poor, and evidently they don't care. It is far, far, short of a First Class experience. This is what you get with a quasi-monopoly to the USA from London. The only merit was the superb A380.

One steward even tapped me and gestured me for a refill.  On the bright side, there seems to be a lot of generosity with alcohol.

"London to Helsinki return. Check in at T3 quick as was fast track security. I visited the BA lounge in T3 which is nice and used by other Oneworld airlines, apart from being packed there was very limited food on offer at 10am. Boarding was slow and done by bus to a remote stand, onboard the seated in 1A with a fee seat next to me. I was looking forward to something decent to eat due to the lack of food options in the lounge - unfortunately the food offered was pretty basic to say the least. The crew where friendly which I guess was something. Arriving in Helsinki on time to another remote stand and bus transfer bags where off quickly despite any priority tagging. Check in for the return was quick, security a little slow but once through I headed for the Finnair lounge which was packed with no seating. I managed to find a seat in a computer booth have a coffee and check my emails. Boarding was awful with no priority and once again a 10 minute bus ride on a packed bus to then stand in the freezing cold and sleet for a further 10 minutes boarding via steps. After a delayed 1hr departure service began with a drink followed by another very basic meal of 3 half sandwiches and a scone. Crew were okay and kept passengers updated on the delayed arrival. Finally arrived 1 hr late but with the luxury of an airbridge. Bags off quickly which was good. Otherwise a business class on a 3hr flight with no in seat power, economy seating with middle seat blocked. Standard food offered in economy on other airlines.

"Flew from EDI-LHR-PHL-LHR-EDI in World Traveller. Outbound shuttle to Heathrow was a Boeing 767-300 in all economy layout, managed to bag seats 1F/1G using online checkin. Cheery, friendly crew - biggest problem is the excessive hand baggage allowance permitted on BA. Selfish people take huge cases on board, filling up the lockers so everyone with more modestly sized items can't get a look in. Cabin crew quite stressed trying to move cases around lockers to get everyone sat down. LHR-PHL upgraded to the rearmost group of two seats on Row 35 on  Boeing 777-200. BA has now cheekily increased the cost of these to £48 each - used to be only £33 like the rest of the cabin. Wisecracking captain over the tannoy made the flight a little more entertaining - again great crew, I could eat the meal for once. Only thing that went wrong was the IFE on my seat crashed in the last 90 minutes of the flight - I could only view the flight tracker. On a side note, I wish BA would upgrade the album choice, they haven't changed it in the last year. Flight was on time no delays. Inbound PHL-LHR I reserved a seat for £33 each, but note you cannot buy the back row on the middle group - reserved for the crew. Plane encountered severe turbulence between Nantucket and Newfoundland, crew had to rush the drinks and the meal service as a result.  No apologies from the pilots about this which BA usually does. LHR-EDI problems about excessive hand baggage exacerbated on the smaller A320.  It was the same steward by sheer coincidence that served us on the outbound shuttle a week earlier and he did remember us, and asked us how our holiday in Philadelphia went! Otherwise flight was pleasant and did what it said on the tin. Overall it was a good value trip - I booked it through BA Holidays, and it being off-season meant the total cost was £940 (before seat upgrades) including 8 days car rental. One observation however it that it is now clear that BA cares little about its economy passengers (who now seem to exist to make up the numbers) - everything now seems to be geared around their high-spending Executive Club members. Avios earning has been drastically cut in the World Traveller cabin class, so a discounted fare now only attracts 0.25 Avios in the mile. Therefore a transatlantic flight to the East Coast of the USA (which used to get 3250 points), now only attracts a measily 815. Pretty pathetic really. I really only use British Airways via LHR for USA trips purely on the basis of using large widebody planes (unlike American and United who increasingly use Boeing 757s) , and their holidays deals which are hard to beat and enable payment instalments.",10,2016-03-06, United Kingdom ,False,flew edi lhr phl lhr edi world traveller outbound shuttle heathrow boeing economy layout managed bag seat f g using online checkin cheery friendly crew biggest problem excessive hand baggage allowance permitted ba selfish people take huge case board filling locker everyone modestly sized item get look cabin crew quite stressed trying move case around locker get everyone sat lhr phl upgraded rearmost group two seat row boeing ba cheekily increased cost used like rest cabin wisecracking captain tannoy made flight little entertaining great crew could eat meal thing went wrong ife seat crashed last minute flight could view flight tracker side note wish ba would upgrade album choice changed last year flight time delay inbound phl lhr reserved seat note cannot buy back row middle group reserved crew plane encountered severe turbulence nantucket newfoundland crew rush drink meal service result apology pilot ba usually lhr edi problem excessive hand baggage exacerbated smaller steward sheer coincidence served u outbound shuttle week earlier remember u asked u holiday philadelphia went otherwise flight pleasant said tin overall good value trip booked ba holiday season meant total cost seat upgrade including day car rental one observation however clear ba care little economy passenger seem exist make number everything seems geared around high spending executive club member avios earning drastically cut world traveller cabin class discounted fare attracts avios mile therefore transatlantic flight east coast usa used get point attracts measily pretty pathetic really really use british airway via lhr usa trip purely basis using large widebody plane unlike american united increasingly use boeing holiday deal hard beat enable payment instalment

"Bucharest to London Heathrow and the worst thing above all are the British Airways business class seats and the shocking lack of legroom. Cramped into a space which is less than many economy seats. And this was Club Europe! Poor breakfast - one slice of bacon, half tomato a few tinned mushrooms and an omelette so overcooked it was grey inside. Seat itself was comfortable and staff were good.

"Washington to Heathrow with British Airways and I have to say that the IAD ground crew and inflight crew are fantastic. I sprained my neck just 2 days before departure and was given the option to pre board, which made all the difference. The flight itself was amazing - the A380 is just like a rock in the sky, I didn't feel a thing. The seat comfort on the upper deck in coach is more than adequate - in fact it reminds me of economy plus on United. The premium economy is more like domestic business class on most US carriers (older style business class not the new business first). The major downside - as I write this in the middle of my trip - is the ground staff at Heathrow. They are hard to find if they even exist. I'm in the middle of a terminal to terminal connection, still wearing my brace - and when asking about gate assignments and better options for seating, the best I got was a brusque ""sorry that's all there is."" When you see someone limping away from your desk - at least ask if they'd like some assistance getting to the departure lounge.

"First time my partner and I have flown British Airways for some years and we will not be returning after our flight from London Heathrow to Cape Town. I booked the flights several months before and had to pay £40 to pre-select our seats both ways (£160). On both outward and inward flights my entertainment system was not working. Attempts by staff to re-boot the system failed so I had to cope with two 12-hour flights with no entertainment. On the flight out my table was broken. When I raised this with the crew, I was told that a previous passenger must have ""bounced a child on it."" Dinner was very good but breakfast was appalling. There was only congealed egg and bacon. When asked if I could have a Continental equivalent, all I got was a stodgy choc chip muffin and some fruit juice. The plane looked generally tired. We had to share one inflight magazine between us. The pillows and blankets were a very uninviting brown colour. My partner's entertainment system did work but she did have to get a stewardess to use a spoon to release the handset from its position in her seat.

"British Airways from Manchester to Rio de Janeiro via Heathrow. Weren't invited to the lounge at MAN due to a rather arrogant check in agent. The Concord Lounge at LHR has seen better days - ordered a bacon sandwich which arrived far too promptly and was limp and rather pathetic, so left it! Champagne on boardng was warm as was the water. Nuts were pleasant. Seat area was genuinely filthy and had not been thoroughly cleaned with remnants of the toiletries bag between the seats from the last passengers. First choice of food not available, which is unacceptable in First. Then a whole row of seats just stopped working so my seat was in a permanent 20 degree incline. Staff attempted to get them working but to no avail. We ended being split up, partner on row 4, me on row 2! Nice start to our honeymoon, thanks BA. Cheese selection on the menu had changed and was offered a scrappy piece of paper to advise new selections. Staff upgrades are commonplace on BA in First and the cabin had by my reckoning, 5 paying passengers and I'd say about 4 staff upgrades (all of whom appeared after we had been pushed back from the gate). These 'mates' of crew are showered with attention throughout the flight. Personally I'd have preferred to see some of the full fare business class passengers upgraded with staff passengers thankful for a seat, but BA seem to think it's acceptable for staff to travel in First. If you're on flying on business and hoping for an upgrade, I'd say you're chances are pretty remote, unless of course you know one of the crew for that flight!

"Flew British Airways from Los Angeles to Amsterdam via London Heathrow r/t in Club World. Actually prefer the B777 over the A380 which was surprising.

Food and drinks good, even if the steak was a bit on the well done side. Like that you can pre-select meals out of LHR. Wish you could do this out of LAX as well. My complaint is Club Europe legroom.

"Our first time flying to Dominican Republic and found the best deal with British Airways and the benefit was it is a direct flight from Gatwick to Punta Cana. On the outbound flight, the plane was half empty, so it was nice and spacious. The BA Boeing 777 is an outdated plane which has been used in their fleet for many years and has not had a refurb I would say in about 10+ years - I suppose this is why the flight was so cheap. The staff on board were friendly and efficient. The seat pitch is large so I could sit for 9+ hours comfortably, the seats despite the plane being old, were comfortable and not showing signs of wear. The entertainment system is what shows the age of the plane, one of the smallest screens in the industry. They are very small, and the anti-glare screen is hard to see from you need to keep adjusting the brightness of the screen throughout the movie. The range of movies was good.

"Flight got off to a good start with a reasonable dinner in the Malaysian Airlines first Class lounge. I was looking forward to my first flight on the Boeing 787 -  so much so, I switched from Singapore / LHR to KL when I discovered the 787-9 operated on this route. The new plane is very nice indeed - the so called ""new"" - New First is not. BA trumpet they have listened to customers and this revised version was to be the new pace setter. Wrong. The FAs on the route were great and dinner was adequate. The chicken satays followed by prawn and mango salad was fine. The wine was also fine. The cheap champagne nowhere near to Krug as served by other carriers in 1st Class. The usual cheap stainless steel cutlery and boring glassware and chinaware - we have to get used to. The seat is definitely more constrained than the 777 and A380 1st Class; its tighter and smaller. In bed mode - it is like sleeping on a park bench. So hard. The ridiculous ""island"" design for the table and retractable dinning table is worse than the 777 and A380. When lying on your side it digs into your back. The seat's narrow profile becomes very obvious. You have to be a gymnast to get into and out of the ""compartment"". I am 6 4"" tall and not overweight. I did not sleep hardly at all when compared with the A380 flight I took to Singapore last month. The TV screen is larger and fixed - which does not lend itself to a companion dinning with you as on the other aircraft. Its on a slight angle as well slightly facing away from the viewer. The AV remote is small and overly complicated. There is no WiFi. There is no window blinds as on the other aircraft. The windows can be dimmed to ""black"" - so you have two black orbs staring at you through the flight. BA seem clueless when it comes to a top end 1st Class. I will avoid this plane in future.

"London Heathrow to Vancouver with British Airways. Outbound flight was delayed by 2 hours. Email was received on the day of travel. It did take 2 calls to the airline to establish if one could arrive later. On the first call, there was such a poor understanding of the question that the operator thought we wanted to rebook flights. Fortunately we were cut off as I think the call might have continued for the rest of the day. Second call was more successful and a direct answer was given, no matter how unwelcome. Printing your own baggage labels was a new experience at LHR (I am not a frequent air traveller). A sign of the times perhaps but I did get the impression of going through a self checkout at a supermarket. Not much to say about bag drop off. It was neither efficient nor inefficient, just a linear series of a few tasks performed by someone doing their job. The young chap at drop off said that the delay started as 10 minutes at the beginning of the week which had turned into two hours by Friday. At the gate, I did wonder why those with priority boarding moved to a different seating area - all of 3 metres away. I suspect people need to be seen receiving value for higher ticket prices, because they will of course get there first! The flight was just about adequate. My video screen did not work and despite requests to 2 cabin crew this was not rectified - well I was ignored. Fortunate, as the film and TV choice was poor.  I do not like airline food that much. There are plenty of food outlets past security to get something decent to eat. Never really drink the wine. Beer and spirits hard to get wrong. Return flight was only made better by the jet stream reducing the flight time by an hour. Again the flight was just about adequate. Did not eat the food as I had a salad from an outlet at YVR - good value. Flight attendant said it looked better than what they were serving. The seat in front of me was broken so it reclined further than it should. The only solution provided by another attendant was to get up walk around a bit, and stand at the back.

"Seattle to Tel Aviv via London with British Airways. The food was below average and the cabin staff service was average. The seats are comfortable and are OK as long as you do not have a seat where someone has to step over you or you have to step over someone else. The inflight entertainment system uses a dual prong plug in for their inflight entertainment system so I had to use their headphones which are not comfortable for long periods of time. After going outside of airport security for a long layover at LHR and coming back through the security process, BA tried to make my wife check in her carry-on bag which she has used in our travels on many airlines around the world without question - and was already accepted on our first leg from Seattle. Her bag fit in BA's measurement gage frame, but the BA desk agent did not like how I put it in. Apparently it has to not only fit, but it can only be placed in the gage with a straight up and down motion only. After complaining that her requirement was unnecessary, the desk agent relented in a huff. BA also required that I pay to chose my seats after buying a 7000 USD business class ticket. I am a Alaska MVP Gold member so I can fly BA as a partner airline and get mileage credit, but I cannot book seats without paying.

"Gatwick is not my first choice but for Naples with British Airways it is the only choice so we reluctantly booked a return Club Europe ticket for a treat. Check in fast and friendly, and fast track was amazing, we were the only people using it. The BA lounges at Gatwick have been closed and we were sent to the No 1 lounge which BA is using instead. To say it is less good is an understatement. £8 for a glass of champagne (whereas free in the old BA lounge) is just ridiculous. The atmosphere is more Weatherspoons than Fortnum and Mason and the crowd was noisy and chaotic. If what we were told is true (the lounge will be used until next year) we will be avoiding it next time and probably avoiding BA in that case. Food was small portions and service bordering on rude from the barman who explained very impolitely that they do not serve diet drinks. Once on board the crew were welcoming and friendly and the afternoon tea adequate but not exactly filling (disappointing after the rubbish we were served in the lounge). Return flight from Naples began with another abysmal lounge experience. Windowless, crowded and with very limited food and drink, again not worth the bother. Crew again were wonderful and very chatty and friendly. New layout A320 and we had booked 1 A and C. Totally unacceptable seats. No bulkhead so right up by the main boarding door. No carpet, just a rubber floor and during boarding I was constantly bashed by peoples bags and during the flight my feet were trodden on by people waiting for the toilet. Nowhere to stow my single bag because everyone else had two or more and had used all the space, had to stow mine five rows behind delaying my disembarkation. Dinner was nice. Baggage last off the belt despite being priority tagged. Had it not been for the crew on both flights I would have thought the money was wasted booking Club Europe.

"My first time in First class on any airline. Joined the flight from a connection so didn't do First check in but boarded without incident. Met at the door by the purser, greeted by name and shown to my seat. Masses of space, very comfortable and private, given it is semi-open. Not a huge amount of storage around the seat but my case fitted into my personal locker at the front of my seat. My partner and I were in 4E/4F at the back of the cabin, (front of the lower deck). No disturbance from the galley. Choose a window seat if travelling alone. Being a day flight, we didn't have beds made up. The cabin is classic yet contemporary and elegant. Pre-departure drinks included Grand Siecle Champagne. We both chose the tasting menu option. I didn't like the lobster starter and staff substituted a course from the a la carte menu. Food was outstanding and wine pairing worked well. To be a bit fussy, the steak was overcooked to the point of being unenjoyable. IFE was good although no time to watch movies. The screen is attached to the side of the seat and has to be docked for take off and landing (as in Club World), which is very irritating. First off the plane, although that doesn't matter much as immigration at MIA is always a nightmare. I've flown BA for many years in other cabins and cost cutting is evident everywhere. Their Club World is a joke compared to every long haul competitor but First is still a world leader. I was very pleased to fly BA and relieved that they still have it when it comes to cosseting in first class. I paid for this flight as part of a return itinerary but took the train from London to Paris to start (flew Club Europe from there to Heathrow) and then Economy class back to Paris on American Airlines.

"British Airways business Class from Edinburgh to Las Vegas return via Heathrow. Cabin crew on both flights were very helpful and attentive. Part of the business class cabin on the 747 is located in the upper cabin with 20 seats and two dedicated crew. The seating configuration however is just odd. The window seat faces backwards and aisle street faces forwards. There is a privacy screen, but if you are not travelling with a friend or family member you'll be looking at a complete stranger for the duration of your flight.

"London Heathrow to Dubai and I feel sorry for British Airways. I have just flown one of my last ever flights with them as they have fallen into the depths of being second rate against far superior competition. The lounges at T5 Heathrow should be great, but we arrived last night at 6pm to find almost all the food offer finished, so it's soup or a jacket potato and beans then! So much nicer to spend £20 and buy a decent meal from one of the many eateries in T5 instead. Then onto the plane which was tired. As usual, bits of all 4 of our seats were broken. My wife's tv. My sound only worked in the left ear. A really dirty blanket (and no spares at all). Very late food service. But to be fair, and for a change, the stewardesses weren't their usual BA indifferent style but fairly good and certainly polite. But this is business class, and it certainly doesnt feel like it any more. I try to support British jobs, but Emirates is cheaper and better.

"1730 British Airways flight from Barcelona to Heathrow on 30th January, seated in 28F right at the back. Flight was chockers. We were delayed taking off by an hour due to problems with French Air Traffic Control testing a new computer system. I had onward connection to Hong Kong which was already tight, told the crew, they responded promptly, and I was met at Heathrow with a luminescent envelope which gave me priority through security (I just made the connection). Onboard the crew were upbeat and attentive, the snack was fine, some sort of chicken roll and a very good coffee and chocolate cake. I guess it was the last flight of the day, so it had that lovely end of term feel about it, everyone was relaxed despite the delay. I think people are a bit hard on BA, they're not flash but for short hops anyway they get the job done.

As a loyal British Airways customer for 20 years, I have noticed wide variations in the type of flight attendant service and meal/beverage service provided on longhaul flights.

"Thanks to a time change from 23.55 to 00.05, which brought forward our departure by almost 24 hours, we very nearly missed our flight back from Rio de Janeiro to London. The check-in desks were crowded out by Team GB athletes returning home from a training session and we were relieved to get the fast track treatment. The first/business lounge at GIG is one of the worst we've been in. Our seats were 1E/F and seemed marginally better than the first class seats on a 747, although still far off the standard of British Airways competitors. 1E/F also suffer from being near the galley and there was one crew member who spent much of the night talking away to her colleagues. 1A and 1K seemed to be occupied by BA employees and there was far too much schmoozing going on. Service on the whole was reasonably good, although none of the food on the menu was actually available. This was rather feebly blamed on the changeover from one month to the next. The IFE worked reliably and the large screen had a much better resolution than on 747s. Overnight the temperature in the cabin was set too high, which resulted in an uncomfortable sleep under the duvet in the pyjamas provided.

The British Airways outbound flight from London to Hong Kong was on a 3 year old A380. We sat near the back on the upper deck and were very pleased with how comfortable and smooth it was.

"I was originally booked on a United Airlines flight from London to Boston, connecting through Washington Dulles, but this was cancelled because of the snow in DC. United rebooked me onto British Airways to complete the flight to Boston. Without a doubt, BA is one of the worst airlines I have flown on. Upon arriving at check in, I was told that I could only check in one bag, despite being allowed to take two bags on United. United said that I would be able to travel on an equivalent service with BA. The check in supervisor at Heathrow informed me that I would have to pay £65 to bring the bag. When I complained said ""it's not my problem"". I asked if they could call United to clarify the bag issue, but they refused, saying ""we don't even talk to United"" - in the end I didn't pay and will get it sent at a later date. The onboard service was very disappointing. The food was barely edible. The staff were loud and abrupt, providing the bare minimum service and yelling across the cabin at each other making the whole journey even more unpleasant. The inflight entertainment failed multiple times, and passengers started to be reseated because of the problem.

"My son and I flew British Airways from Glasgow to Paris on the 7th January and returned on the 11th. On out outward journey, the London flight was cancelled, so there was a knock on with our Paris flight. We did get to London, the staff were great at helping us transfer to the 5B terminal to get the flight to Paris. But I noticed that by the time we would get to Paris, we would have missed the last shuttle bus to Disney. I mentioned this to the crew, who were very good at helping, realising that I was travelling with a young adult with learning disabilities. During the flight, one member of crew kept me updated. THere were some BA managers onboard as passengers. Before we landed, he came back and told me that one of the managers would get us through to the taxis and explain to the driver where we were going and ask for a receipt. (My french is minimal, so I'd have been lost) The manager told me to keep our boarding passes and receipt amd claim BA for the taxi. My son and i had a great weekend, got home and a couple of days later, I claimed for a refund. Alas, the computer said a big fat no. It was just bad luck that we'd had to rebook flights I explained that it was a BA manager who told me to claim and it wouldn't take much to actually find out who flew on the flight. But still, no. Our insurance won't pay either because we didn't have a long enough delay! Ok, legally, BA may be in the right, but morally, well. Even the insurance company thought there should be a bit of leeway.

"This was the return leg of our British Airways flight on BA056 from Johannesburg to London Heathrow on 18th January. While the majority of staff onboard where courteous and friendly, it was the behaviour of one individual within the crew who was serving my husband that left us both feeling extremely incensed that we had paid a lot of money to basically be served by a moody, petulant crew member. She is blatantly in the wrong job because she had zero customer service skills and treated us as if we were a major inconvenience to her. British Airways may have some great crew who go out of their way to make your flight a positive, enjoyable experience, but if you are unfortunate enough to experience the above negative behaviour, this makes you anti booking future flights with this company. Is this really the way BA wants its customers to feel? Being a member of cabin crew requires a range of skills - if you present yourself as a friendly, amiable part of the team giving your passengers a great flight surely you can walk away knowing you have fulfilled your part, instead of putting so much energy into giving so little. After all, isn't it us, the customers, who choose to fly with you and support you as an airline.

"Flew British Airways from Kuwait to Edinburgh via London Heathrow return, out 27 December, and back on 10 January. Although the flights were full, the cabin crew were efficient, friendly and professional. I flew World Traveller Plus on the international legs, and was more than happy with the space, choice of in-flight entertainment and the food. When I headed out to the galley to grab a single-malt scotch mid-way through the flight to UK, no problems at all. On the return flight, I had the best fillet of beef I have ever been given in an aircraft, and the red wine served with it complemented it nicely.

"Bangkok to London Heathrow on British Airways. I have lived in Thailand for 4 years now and try to go back to the UK at least once a year to visit family and friends. Normally, I fly either Emirates to Manchester or to Heathrow with EVA Air. This time around, BA came up with a fairly competitive price. The aircraft wasn't in particularly impressive shape and in-flight entertainment unit was quite outdated and didn't work for the first 2 hours of the flight. Once it did work, the screen was awful and very dark. I can't fathom why BA are using outdated entertainment systems when rivals such as EVA, Emirates and even Thai Airways are much more current. Inflight service was okay for the most part. Regular trips by the staff for refreshments in the first few hours, but this certainly died down afterwards. After using the call system to get the attention of a staff member, I was abruptly asked to switch it off and asked if I had a problem. No problem, just would like a drink please. However, alcohol (apart from wine) had ran out. I'm not a massive drinker, but do have a couple of whiskey and cokes on a flight. Also, there was no Wi-Fi, no charge points for mobile devices. This is again in contrast with Emirates, Thai Airways and EVA. All in all,  I have to say it was a disappointing experience.

"Late evening departure on BA28 from Hong Kong to Heathrow, plane fully booked (pre-Christmas season) in all classes. My seat was 2K, the senior male purser presented himself and addressed me with my Christian name - I did not object, had the impression that this is part of a nice intimate atmosphere. During the flight I found out that the majority of the 14 pax in First class preferred a more formal approach and were addressed with their family names. The purser offered the champagne welcome drink and I gladly accepted, and soon my face turned pale : the champagne was almost as warm as a cup of tea. His apology came prompt, but too late. They simply had no cool drinks on board and needed about an hour - or 30 minutes after takeoff - to have the respective drinks at the right temperature level. British Airways did not control this service process properly. Maybe nobody was in charge, maybe it was simply forgotten. The plane had arrived in Hong Kong about 5 hours earlier, so there was enough time to take care of the quality of beverages. The remaining flight was ok - cordial hosts in the predominantly male service team, food not sensational, but it was after midnight, so no complaints in this respect. Seat was fine, had a nice sleep during the 12.5 hour flight, breakfast options okay, arrival ahead of schedule. So is there a reason to complain and to give rather low marks? Yes, we are talking about first class in a leading European airline. The product has to be perfect, that's part of the game in first. Serious irregularities result in harsh reaction of the customer.

"Club class on British Airways between Cape Town and London. Boeing 747-400 has the flat bed and while the quality of the cabin was inferior to the A380 between London and Johannesburg, it remains one of the better business class product. Check in at the BA counters in Cape Town would have been a breeze, was it not for the unexpected six hour delay in the departure of the flight. The upgrade from Premium to Club class made this inconvenience almost bearable. However,  Cape Town airport becomes like a ghost town when all flights but yours have departed. BA's Executive lounge in Cape Town is spacious and serves good food and Cape wines. There are free internet and computers and a friendly service, even at midnight. While comfortable, BA's Club seats on the 747 can do with an upgrade. They are configured in a 2-4-2 layout, with one passenger facing forward and the one adjacent facing backward, at the side row - the middle row has two forward and two backward facing. This is something I never understood - why facing backward because it just makes no sense. The seats are separated by a hard plastic cseparator that moves up and down with the push of a button. Theoretically, the air hostess should walk behind the front-facing seat to serve the backward-facing passenger at the window - however, on my flight the air hostess insisted on leaning over me, pushing the button to lower the separator and serving the accross my seat - after about three times this really got annoying. The problem is that if you don't raise the separator, you and your fellow passengers stare straight at each other from a distance of less than one meter. Food was satisfactory, rather than outstanding. . The starter choices were poached Norwegian Salmon with marinated prawns or an oyster mushroom salad. Main courses included Ballotine of chicken with Port, Drakensberg trout, pasta or a cold main course salad of za'atar beef medallion. I chose the chicken and it was OK, but inferior to my mother's Sunday roast chicken. There was a selection of South African Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and some good reds. Breakfast was a choice of a cheese omelette, continental or a traditional English breakfast with bacon, sausages, mushrooms and potatoes. Arriving in London, I took the supposedly fast track option - a big mistake. In theory this is supposed to expedite your progress through customs as a Club passenger, but in practice it was a disaster - there were only two or three border agents present at any time and it took 45 to 60 minutes to get through the fast track immigration - I could see group after group of fellow BA passengers clearing the slow lane long before I took the next few steps forward. BA arrivals lounge was a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of Heathrow Terminal 5. All in all, not a bad experience, but having flown on these seats quite a few times over the past 15 or more years, I really think it is time to either upgrade the Club cabin on the 747's.",7,2016-01-12, Canada ,False,club class british airway cape town london boeing flat bed quality cabin inferior london johannesburg remains one better business class product check ba counter cape town would breeze unexpected six hour delay departure flight upgrade premium club class made inconvenience almost bearable however cape town airport becomes like ghost town flight departed ba executive lounge cape town spacious serf good food cape wine free internet computer friendly service even midnight comfortable ba club seat upgrade configured layout one passenger facing forward one adjacent facing backward side row middle row two forward two backward facing something never understood facing backward make sense seat separated hard plastic cseparator move push button theoretically air hostess walk behind front facing seat serve backward facing passenger window however flight air hostess insisted leaning pushing button lower separator serving accross seat three time really got annoying problem raise separator fellow passenger stare straight distance le one meter food satisfactory rather outstanding starter choice poached norwegian salmon marinated prawn oyster mushroom salad main course included ballotine chicken port drakensberg trout pasta cold main course salad za atar beef medallion chose chicken ok inferior mother sunday roast chicken selection south african chardonnay sauvignon blanc good red breakfast choice cheese omelette continental traditional english breakfast bacon sausage mushroom potato arriving london took supposedly fast track option big mistake theory supposed expedite progress custom club passenger practice disaster two three border agent present time took minute get fast track immigration could see group group fellow ba passenger clearing slow lane long took next step forward ba arrival lounge welcome relief hustle bustle heathrow terminal bad experience flown seat quite time past year really think time either upgrade club cabin
"Just returned from Orlando to London via Miami, that we booked direct with British Airways. The outgoing flight was really good. However, a totally different story on the return flight. We were redirected to check in with American Airlines as we had an internal connecting flight. Although we checked in shortly after the check in opened, the only seating was preferred meaning we had to pay extra for flights we believed we had paid in full. Additionally my family was split up. The AA check in would not allow us to check into the long haul flight from Miami to London. After phoning we discovered we had been checked in but not allowed to choose seats.

"Avios points flight to London from Toronto for Christmas in Business class. Slow queue for check in though given flying just Christmas there were a lot of people and luggage to be fair. The BA club lounge at Pearson remains well run and clean. Too few toilets and a really unimaginative wine selection being the only issues. Onboard, the usual slow service taking coats (I had to ask), papers, drink, menu amenity kit - very random and fragmented delivery by an assortment of crew. The meal service was fast with drinks served first. The evening meal was average at best and overcooked, with the tray delivered with the starter and dessert already on it with the hot entrée dumped on the tray and that was it. Had to ask for cheese and a second coffee. Across the piece, you can see the cuts and money saving British Airways are making to business class. Even now - the two posh chocolates have been replaced by a unwrapped chocolate finger, no flower in the toilets, no drinks offered after dinner. The list goes on! Breakfast was nothing special with an egg and bacon muffin which is at least edible (unlike the previous bacon baguette.) Reasonable entertainment choices. Crew were the usual indifferent long haul ""I'm here as a favour to you all"" with little rapport or effort in delivering a world class service!

"Las Vegas to London with British Airways was awful. We were in first class, travelling with 2 young children and wanted to put them to bed on this long flight, and we had booked a row of 4 seats so we could sleep one child one adult. We check in at first class which was delayed, as they are busy and have moved some economy passengers to the first class line to speed up things. Then we are told one of our seats has been moved, the staff are unsure as to why and will rectify this immediately and bring my boarding pass to the lounge. An hour later I go to the check in desk as nobody from BA has been bothered to come - I am then told, actually your seat is broken nothing we can do, and its now my problem. This seat is in the middle, therefore it means either one child alone on the otherside of the cabin or the 2 children together behind me and my husband alone the other side of the cabin. No other options and British Airways are not prepared to ask anyone to swap seats so we can sit 2 together on different rows. We kept the children together behind me, obviously meaning I could not sleep the whole flight and my husband was alone. Then the lamp on my childs seat malfunctioned and was on full beam the whole night flight keeping one of them awake - the attendents were unable to override the light - seriously. They did offer to seat my child at the front of the cabin in a different seat, alone surrounded by strangers or to move me to the front which would have left my children completely alone.

"Watch out for fog diversions at Pisa! We arrived over Pisa on time, circled for 20 minutes and then diverted to Genoa. This was because of fog at Pisa and the fact that there was no instrument landing system. We subsequently found that the ILS has not been working for some time and will not be working for a good while yet. Fog is common at Pisa in the winter. We could understand a last minute diversion because of unexpected factors. However, there have been frequent diversions yet British Airways gave no advance warning that there might be trouble. We had a long wait at a deserted Genoa airport and no British Airways or other staff were on hand to assist or offer drink or food.

"British Airways flight from London Heathrow to Glasgow. Shabby cabin, lacklustre cabin crew, flight deck crew whose announcements were mainly less than informative. A crew which appeared to be going through the motions with little enthusiasm and as little engagement with passengers as possible. Some time after the cabin crew had closed all of them, the overhead locker above my seat fell open before the plane even moved off stand at LHR. On descent into GLA it opened again and hung open for several minutes and I was tempted to unclip and close it. I made the passenger across the aisle aware in case the bags fell out on top of him. Eventually, the cabin crew member whose jump seat faced up that aisle got up and closed it. We should have been sitting upfront given our ticket class (part of a longer trip), but, after service issues with BA and a long journey prior to this flight, we couldn't be bothered pointing that out.

"Malta to Gatwick. I have gripes about British Airways pre-flight charges (I had to pay £30 for checked baggage and £21 to change seats), but in my case the total cost of the flight was only slightly higher than an equivalent Ryanair flight, and the difference in comfort and service is worth the extra cost. Cabin was clean and the new slimline seats were quite comfortable. Crew was upbeat and polite, and served a snack and a well-packed lunchbox. I wish BA would offer inflight wifi and power outlets, but if all BA flights are this good and only a bit more expensive than Ryanair/easyjet I will fly with them more often.",1,2016-01-05, United Kingdom ,False,malta gatwick gripe british airway pre flight charge pay checked baggage change seat case total cost flight slightly higher equivalent ryanair flight difference comfort service worth extra cost cabin clean new slimline seat quite comfortable crew upbeat polite served snack well packed lunchbox wish ba would offer inflight wifi power outlet ba flight good bit expensive ryanair easyjet fly often

"This was my first time on British Airways flying from Tel Aviv to Philadelphia via London. The seats were as comfortable as economy class can be expected to be, though I would've liked the headphone jack to be on the front of the armrest rather than on the inside (which led to the jack on my headphones getting bent and ruined). Food was pretty good. The best part of my British Airways experience was the AVOD system. Flights were on time except for the expected delays at Heathrow. My only major complaint is the taxes and fees that British Airways charges even with award tickets - it almost negates the benefit of using an award ticket. All told, British Airways is better than U.S. airlines, but not at the level of Iberia (which I flew on my way to Tel Aviv) and probably well below Emirates, Singapore and the world's best airlines.",8,2016-01-05, United States ,False,first time british airway flying tel aviv philadelphia via london seat comfortable economy class expected though would liked headphone jack front armrest rather inside led jack headphone getting bent ruined food pretty good best part british airway experience avod system flight time except expected delay heathrow major complaint tax fee british airway charge even award ticket almost negates benefit using award ticket told british airway better u airline level iberia flew way tel aviv probably well emirate singapore world best airline

The seat was very narrow and the remote for the entertainment was on top of the armrest. Food was below the the standard I would expect from a national airline, small portions.

"My partner and I traveled British Airways from Gatwick to Punta Cana on 29th December. After checking in online and paying an extra £45 each way per person to reserve seats after already paying over £4000 for our flights (wasn't a major issue and was expected), we discovered that selecting our outgoing seats was fine, but our return seats had only 2 seats left both on opposite sides of the cabin. Being a nervous flyer I was not up for sitting by myself for nearly 9 hours so we decided to try to discuss the issue at our baggage drop off point, the gentleman working behind the drop off was as helpful as he could be, but basically said that we would have to raise the issue when we left Punta Cana, and that it wasn't likely for us to be able to do anything because remaining seats would be left for business and first class travellers. Getting onto the plane we were the first ones to be called up to board before economy which was good but getting onto the aircraft we discovered an extremely dated plane, with tv screens the size of my iPhone and worn tatty seats with not as much leg room as other airlines we have flown premium economy. After take off we were given a meal with the only option being chicken or beef which was okay, flight attendants then offered us drinks - once we had our drinks gave us at the same time two bottles of sparkling wine which we hadn't asked for and we were happy with, and thought that perhaps the service would make up for the dated flight. But then 5 hours into the flight we had seen absolutely no staff whatsoever and had soon discovered from overheard conversations that a lot of the onboard staff's family were on board and they were all staying in Punta Cana for 5 days before flying home. One member of staff appeared around 6 hours into the flight and gave their families and friends champagne from first class - and walked past everybody else. My partner then asked a staff member for 2 glasses of water and we were told we would have to walk to the back of the economy cabin to get them. When we arrived at the back of the crowded economy cabin we discovered several staff fast asleep and had to wake somebody for water. 1 hour before descending we were given tea and coffee and sandwiches which were fine. All staff in our cabin looked half asleep, with hair all over the place. Considering this was a 2pm flight you'd have thought it was an evening flight. We arrived in Punta Cana at 7pm extremely disapointed with the poor service and the dated plane we had endured for almost 9 hours.

"British Airways from Vienna to Newcastle via Heathrow return, flights on-time. Economy on an A320. FA’s much better on domestic legs, while both times on VIE legs the FA’s were professional, but nothing more and not doing more than absolutely required. Information from the flight deck was friendly and excellent. A snack and drinks were served - snack a highly processed sandwich (barely edible) on the VIE flights and crisps/biscuits on the NCL flights. Additional drinks on request. A320 featured the new slim seats and I miss the older more comfortable BA seats with better leg room. BA has recently changed the rules and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. Selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs EUR 18). If one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping EUR 75 at the airport or EUR 35 online. Being Oneworld Sapphire does not help either. No privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checked luggage. So, BA became a low cost model, except for drinks service. However the prices do not reflect this change in service. On the last leg LHR-VIE carry-on luggage was heavily policed. Although my carry-on luggage met the weight requirements and fits in the overhead bin and has so without any problems on the previous three legs and twenty previous BA flights, I was required to check it in. It was also not a question of occupied space, as it happened in the priority line. Hopefully just a power trip by the gate agent. However, here goes the main advantage of BA, which was a carry-on policy that enabled passengers to realistically travel without the hassle of checking bags. Boarding by the same agent was again bizarre. Instead of priority boarding, there were now four different types of priority boarding, and the procedure left everybody confused and everybody just stood there blocking the access to the gate, so that finally it became a cattle call with everyone boarding at the same time. Another thing is, that recent changes in BA’s frequent flyer program make it impossible to reach a meaningful status even for regular flyer unless you regularly fly Club on long distance routes. Obviously, BA is trying very hard to annoy its frequent travelers. While I stopped flying Business with BA probably a year ago after they downgraded their Club Europe cabin and I was avoiding their long distance flights for a long time due to their terrible seating arrangement, I believe BA’s European economy was a great product and I was using BA regularly for those flights. However, after all these recent changes, I will only book BA if they offer the lowest or close to the lowest fare. For flights to the UK, KLM starts to look pretty good again.

"London Heathrow to Barcelona, and for some reason British Airways continue to run this Barcelona service from the dated Terminal 3 at Heathrow, rather than new T5. That apart, this service was fine.

"I booked a non-refundable round trip ticket, New York to London; Paris to New York. I showed up at JFK 2 hours before my flight and was informed that my ticket had been ""refunded,"" which meant I had no ticket.

I was forced to purchase an expensive ($1300), last minute ticket, for which I have still not been reimbursed, even though, finally, British Airways acknowledged that they had made a big error. I can understand making an error. I cannot understand their unwillingness to help me, when they put me in such a compromised position. Subsequent to the problem on first leg, British Airways Customer Service assured me that my return ticket was not affected, and they even sent me an E-Ticket confirmation of my return. But, again, the morning of my return flight, they told me I had no return ticket. Only then did a Supervisor finally admit that an error had been made, and he rebooked my return, at no cost. Over the course of 2 weeks, however, I spent at least 10 hours trying to get my problem sorted out, first at Heathrow Airport, then on the phone and on email, and I was still left stranded for my return flight.

"This was and will remain the first and last time I will fly British Airways. Having flown this route numerous times before with a popular UK based airline I thought I would try BA. I expected a comparable experience at least, whilst hoping for something a cut above. On the outbound flight we were offered orange or champagne, the return flight was orange juice or water but only half the cabin was served so we didn't get anything. Outbound menu did not correspond with the food on offer and the choice of meal soon became no choice at all as halfway through serving the cabin section of 32 seats they ran out. At least on the return flight they managed two thirds of the cabin section before the options dried up again. There was a number of very disgruntled passengers who wondered what exactly they paid extra for. A minor gripe was the toilet was right through the economy section which I'm sure got on those passengers nerves. Seats were ok but the quality of the media system was poor and the touch screen was unreliable and a number of them didn't work at all so more upset passengers.

"Having previously flown with British Airways on their European routes, I thought I would take a long haul flight with them. I arrived 2 hours before departure at Heathrow Terminal 3 and couldn't quite understand what was going on; the queue to actually drop my pre-checked luggage was long, very long, hearing customers complaining they were standing in line for a good hour, and that there were no signs of BA taking any steps to remedy the situation. Even with my frantic tweeting at BA, nothing improved. The situation boiled down to the fact that only 4 desks were open for the general public on the day that schools finished. Needless to say, whoever was in charge that day didn't really know what they were doing and caused a lot of agro for many customers, and BA needs to take full responsibility of this. Once these proceedings had passed, I found myself boarding the Boeing 747-400 which was tired and not very well maintained. Leg room was atrociously tight, with a metal support for the seat in front of me limiting the actual usable legroom. The inflight entertainment had a good selection of films, but was made to be disappointing with the meagre 7"" to 9"" screens. The staff was very friendly. Looking after our area was a charming staff who really made us feel welcome and did his very best to find some people seconds if they were left hungry after the meal. The meal was decent, not fantastic.  My only note when it comes to food and drink is that more water should be made available. I found myself constantly thirsty and having to go back to the galley to ask for water. All in all, I wouldn't fly with BA again using their long-haul services unless I were to fly in Business or First. The ground service is terrible.

"British Airways from London Heathrow to Mumbai from Terminal 5 in coach class. Check in uneventful. No boarding priority for people travelling with children, a first for me for any long haul flight. Five minutes before departure, captain announces that someone has checked in a bag but has not turned up so they need to take off the offending suitcase. Fair enough. The staff had botched up loading the suitcase by marking it to be in a container in which it wasn't. Result they started taking off all the containers one by one and searching for the flight. Captain told that he cannot give any estimate. 90 minutes passed after that no announcement, a tired and jaded cabin crew literally disappeared. After 90 mins they realised that people might be hungry and started serving juice. Finally after 1 hr 45 mins captain said that they had found the rogue suitcase and we will be off in 15 mins. The plane suddenly started a push back without any warning. The aircraft was a jaded B747-400, poor seats, poor entertainment equipment which had to be rebooted thrice before it worked.

"Phoenix to London Heathrow, and this was our third time flying First Class on British Airways, and after flying this time, we are disappointed.  The BA lounge in Phoenix is disgusting. We could handle it only for about 5 minutes. From the staff, the seats, the space, the food, nothing was orderly, clean, and it all seemed run-down. Walking around the airport aimlessly was a much better option. The boarding process was a joke. Again, the staff seemed confused, clueless, they called for everyone (all statuses, memberships, traveling with children, etc...all at once. It seemed nearly half of the plane was lined up to get in during premier boarding. There were 3 cabin staff for first class, two out of the three were not at all cordial. No greeting, they seemed to be running around the entire time even when the first class cabin was not full. They were not well groomed or spoke politely - came across unprofessional. This ruined the experience of flying first class. The meal experience was horrible. I ordered an appetizer, salad, and an main course. My husband ordered the 2 appetizers, and a main course. They came back to tell us they were out of one of the appetizers he ordered. First time this has ever happened in first class! They brought my appetizer, which we had to share, and they completely forgot about my salad. They brought the main (chicken dish), which was cold and dry. I had to send it back and changed to a steak. The steak came after about 20 minutes. Roughly 1/4 of the steak was hot, the remainder was cold (not even warm). The taste was amazing but ruined the dining experience completely. Upon waking up I opted to not have breakfast but have biscuits. The menu had ""assortment of biscuits"" and a few other bistro type items. When I ordered coffee and biscuits, the flight attendant looked concerned and said ""let me see if I can find some biscuits for you"". She came back with a bag of popcorn, a browny, and a few vanilla wafers. Typical items served on a domestic US based airline. My husband ordered coffee as well and asked for half and half. She failed to understand half and half and finally said ""oh you mean half and half in British accent. How is it possible to be a flight attendant and you cannot understand an American accent for half and half. Normally this would not even be an issue but having experienced all of the above this just seemed like the icing on the cake. Toilets were small, cramped, and dirty with no typical First Class amenities available within the toilets.

We were able to use the new TAM lounge at terminal 3 GRU, this was an amazing lounge, huge, lots of food and drink on offer, showers, sleeping area, lots of seating. I was apprehensive about the seating plan on BA with the reverse seat by the window and the aisle facing forward. Travelling as a couple, this seating actually works really well, it's good to be able to chat with each other throughout the flight and is much better than the Herringbone seating - that being said if you are travelling alone I can understand why it may not be preferable. Offered champagne on boarding, before dinner further drinks service. The food was excellent which included dinner and breakfast prior to arrival. The seat was very comfortable, full flat bed, the only problem I found was being 6ft 1in, my feet touched the wall at the end and I couldn't fully stretch out but this did not prevent me sleeping. Upon arrival at Heathrow, the luggage was coming around the carousel by the time I got there, which was only about 10-15 mins after disembarkation.

"Third time flying the British Airways A380 and the only reason that we did is because it was a BA Amex 2for1 redemption. However to ensure that we maxed out the experience, as always we pre booked seats. On checking in online seats had been moved, contacted BA Bronze and reply was ""cannot answer why, possibly operational reasons, more information should be available at check in"". Check in, no response. On board our seats were occupied by what appeared to be ""normal"" passengers, i.e. no entourage. Seats we were allocated, lumbar and head rest functions did not operate, cabin crew tried rebooting but no luck, so onwards and upwards. Having flown BA a reasonable amount I have come to the conclusion that the cabin crew, despite operating with poorly designed cabins, poorly maintained (seats) equipment (we had a similar scenario on a Heathrow to LA and return last July where we had the same reg plane, same seats and similar problem which was not fixed after the flight out) manage to maintain a brave company face. BA Club Lounge: Again, food choice poor, running out, although granted peak hours, but if other airlines can cope why cannot BA? Cabin crew: Service very good and friendly. Food reasonable, but nothing that makes you say that ""that was good"". Entertainment: Poor, old ""ish"" and second rate movies, enough said. Seats: Unfortunately in this case we leave the worst till last. Having flown Qantas, Emirates and Qatar A380's like everybody else we wonder why BA did not take the opportunity for a redesign of layout and seat area. Well we know why = £££'s, Question? Does no one on the BA cabin design team wear glasses? There is no storage space, if it goes in the drawer with the shoes, you have to move the seat from sleep position to access, so you are left with the possibility of either wearing and damaging said specs, or hanging them over the separator. Again, competitors manage it. The seat itself, is harder than the competitors above (mattress?) and apparently I discovered that extra pillows are no longer carried, so you have one and thats it. Unfortunately, we do still have to use BA next March, but have booked Qatar again for October. Additionally, the Customer Service service in India is sadly woefully short in all areas, although polite working from scripts and unable to solve / answer simple questions. Frustration. A question for BA: We really want to support and be proud of our national flag carrier but what are the incentives for using BA?

"Recently flew to LA on British Airways and was thoroughly underwhelmed with the experience on the BA A380. I travel regularly in business class on Emirates, normally on the same equipment. The BA configuration upstairs is quite cramped and far inferior to other Airlines, even to the extent of having to stretch over other passengers to leave your seat. In addition the staff seem preoccupied with their own arrangements and although were fine with me, were mildly irritated with the requests of other passengers, openly commenting to each other in front of me. The cleanliness of the plane also left a lot to be desired, after only a couple of hours into the flight, the toilets were disgusting with the floor awash - I don't think crew check them on a regular basis.

"I have been flying to the US regularly from England and have noticed a consistent erosion in the quality of its booking process, website, call centre and ground staff. The British Airways website is unreliable and prone to returning baffling errors even when carrying out the simplest of activities. Its upgrade path is impenetrable and designed to confuse, call centre staff do not seem to speak English and make ridiculous requests and ground staff are didactic. Examples: Cannot check in online, but via the app on a smartphone, no problem (except I wanted a printed boarding pass). Call centre staff in India wanted to speak to my 5 year old daughter when my family accompanied me one one trip, as she was on a different booking and wouldn't give me her flight reference number ""for security reasons"". No problem with ""security reasons"" when I paid BA a lot of money for the ticket. Upgrading with points or Avios fails in the middle of a transaction. The system remains unavailable to check you in for some time after, so you have to call the call centre. BA blacks out so many flights from purchasing with Avios, it's not worth trying unless you're jobless and can fly any time, and don't care where you go. In the queue for boarding my passport wasn't open at the right page and the staff at the gate admonished me as a result. On another occasion at passport control after checking in I was directed back to the BA desk I'd just come from. ""There's nothing wrong with your passport, it must be BAA. It's not us"", was the response. It took a huffing, tutting, BA duty manager to run the visa check again. I advise people to avoid BA if possible. The only reason for choosing BA is flight safety.

My next trip in August was last minute with just First available. I felt very comfortable booking this since my experience in business has always been very nice. My past experiences with First prior to renovated cabins, separate seating cells- I felt it was still going to be a lovely, comfortable experience, with enjoyable food. So, with all the changes in First now, I thought I would really be in for a relaxing treat. I want to preface this by saying I have always loved British Airways and has always been my first choice for London- Houston, JFK-London flights for years. I had a early flight. Checked in in ample time before my flight. I went straight to the Concorde Room to have breakfast. What I was met with was basically a cafeteria style, self serve service. There was no table service, two people working behind the food counter. I met an English couple while waiting in-line to put in a simple scramble eggs on toast order as they and we were both told that the toaster was in front of us, and we needed to toast on own bread. It all went downhill from there. The wait was long, traveling on your own you had to keep an eye on your table to make sure it was not taken, tables were left unserviced and unclean. I carried some dishes to the front just so I could be seated. Boarded plane, seated, and started looking around and the carpet was dirty. It looked as it had not been vacuumed from the last flight, which did not give me a clean and comfortable feeling. The the steward came to me and said they ran out of women's toiletry kits because they do not allot according to reservation, but normally catering to men traveling on business and not women traveling on pleasure. He offered a Men's toiletry kit and a Business Class kit. The food was served. I started with their appetizers which was all dry and very unappetizing (and I am not picky), but for me to find it unappealing it has to be poor. Then the entrees were short and I had to choose a second choice. Any one of these events would be okay- even though they advertised that all is superb, but everything, constantly occurring had me regretting I paid for First and have sworn, for the price differential vs service and quality,  Business Class wins out hands down. The food was far from septacular or tasty - it felt overcooked and choices limited and short. The Pilot did come out and asked if BA could call me and he was very apologetic (I guess a Steward/ess mentioned the faux pas's  - I consented. Disappointment ran consistent from beginning to end - no call, no email, no apology - in my opinion that is the epitome of service from beginning to end. It left me feeling that BA really did not care about any of it - the service in lounges, the appropriate allocation of food, kits, cleanliness- all of it. My flight back to JFK I flew Business. It was comfortable. Though there was less space in First class seats years ago, but the service was brilliant and comfortable and the food was delicious. I am sad my experience this time could not compare to years gone by - even if it was more simplistic.

"Fantastic flight in Club World with British Airways from London Gatwick to Punta Cana. On time departure from Gatwick on a 777-200 - it's true the plane was showing its age with a little wear and tear in the cabin, but seats 2A and 2B were comfortable and functioning perfectly. Greeted by friendly mixed-fleet crew and provided with champagne and amentiy kits before take off. Prompt lunch service after departure and a varied menu with excellent wine choices. I enjoyed a goats cheese and honeyed walnut salad, followed by steak in a port wine sauce which was well cooked and tasty. The delicious Castelnau brut rose champagne was available but disappeared quickly so I recommend ordering this promptly. As this was a leisure flight, all champagne did run out about 3 hours in, for which the crew apologised sincerely, but there was plenty of red and white wine available including an excellent Chablis and Medoc. The Club Kitchen was well stocked throughout and manned by a friendly and personable crew who were always willing to help. Plenty of juice and water runs throughout and a very pleasant afternoon tea served an hour before landing. Bathrooms were well stocked and cleaned regularly. The entertainment system was great in Club with a decent selection of new release films, though the screen resolution could be better, especially Wilhelmina the cabin lighting is on full. We were kept well informed of the flight progress throughout by a cheery and personable First Officer, who navigated a mean-looking thunderstorm near landing with aplomb.

"Las Vegas to London Heathrow in November, after the Thanksgiving Holidays, we splashed out some Avios points for a First Class Upgrade. I have never been so disappointed - Business Class on British Airways is better than First as the cabin is much cleaner and modern. The first class section was dirty and cold, the Entertainment System broke down and had to be rebooted again and again. The service was good but food was nothing special.

"British Airways from Tampa to Gatwick on Boeing 777 Club World. Having travelled out WT Plus to Miami we got a good deal coming back from Tampa so flew Club Class. Checked in at Tampa with no queues, and used the International Lounge at Tampa. Supposed to be exclusive to BA customers this had comfortable seats, and good choice of newspapers and magazines. Did not try WiFi. However, there was disappointingly very poor choice of snacks - a few dried up sorry looking sandwiches which were not replenished during my time there, and crackers with some processed cheese with a few dips, some wine, beer, liquor and soft drinks. Pretty uninspiring stuff. On board comfortable, if narrow, seats that extended into (more or less) flat beds. British Airways still have the very camped 2-4-2 layout with fellow passengers having to clamber over people to go to the rest room etc. Reasonable meal (beef) accompanied by an outstanding Chablis Premier Cru and a very nice Sauvignon Blanc. My wife slept for 5 straight hours - I could only sleep fitfully as not much room at shoulder level but at least the seats were comfortable. Terrible selection of films on the entertainment system.

"London Heathrow to Miami on one of British Airways crummy Boeing 747s. Originally Booked WT Plus choosing flight in an A380 with shiny new updated cabin and entertainment system for 3rd year in a row, and for the 3rd year in a row they promptly changed the plane on my flight for a very elderly and not updated Boeing 747. Do BA actually have any A380's? Reasonably comfortable, but the old on demand entertainment system had a poor choice of films and programs. Cabin staff and food okay from memory but, as usual with British Airways nowadays, very small portions. Took off slightly late in fog, made up time on flight and landed slightly early at Miami.

"London Heathrow to Las Vegas with British Airways. Online check in and seat allocation facility 24 hours before departure are a con! I checked the available flight seats approximately 30 hours prior to check in and virtually 95% of the flight was pre-booked! Therefore, I panicked and prepaid the £70 to secure a window and middle seat as seats had not been allocated to me and wouldn't be until 24hours prior to check in. Then when I did check in approximately 23hrs and 59 minutes prior to travel I had already been allocated 2 seats, one by a window and one in the middle, so a total waste of time me paying £70. I got a refund, but only have the inconvenience of completing online forms and waiting around a month to get my money back. Then when I did get to the airport, the seats I had already paid the extra £70 for had been allocated to someone else (after I had paid for them)and they told me I had to sit in my original 2 seats that had been allocated - an utter farce! British Airways refused to acknowledge their systems were at fault and had use of my funds for almost a month yet had I been advised of my seats prior to check in I would not have paid them £70. They knowingly do this to encourage people to pre-pay for something they knowingly cannot deliver. The aircraft was dirty when we boarded as the fight was late, the toilets were blocked around 10 minutes into the flight and stank - eventually they were blocked off from use, which left 2 out of 4 toilets for the entire rear section of the plane.  The food was abysmal. Afternoon tea on a transatlantic flight used to be pleasant, with scones, cream, jam and nice selection of sandwiches. Now it is a dried up roll and dried excuse of a cake. I am never going to fly British Airways again after the way they handled my complaint - they offered no form of apology that was meaningful or relevant to what I was complaining about and disowned responsibility for the corrupt way their online booking system works.

We therefore spent the 6-7 hours with coats and bags wedged between us making it very difficult to sleep or use the seat tables.

"Montreal to Rome via London with British Airways. Boarded the plane on time (20.30hrs) and sat for six hours on the tarmac while BA tried to clear a glitch in the landing gear system. They finally gave up and cancelled the flight. I had to get to Rome to catch a cruise ship that was departing at 8pm on Tuesday evening, and here I am in Montreal at 1pm Monday, Rome time. British Airways ticket agent refused to help me change my itinerary (""Go to the hotel on the bus and at 2pm today - local time - we will have new itineraries for everyone.""). I tried to explain the urgency to my situation but she cut me off, ""I can't help you, if I help you now I have to help everyone."" When I pressed her further she gave me the BA 800 number, which was closed due to the late hour. Finally I called British Airways Reservations in London, who re-routed me, on American Airlines. The final kick: I put in a claim for a wasted night's guaranteed stay in Rome, and for cancellation compensation. A month later, British Airways advised me that my claim was approved and I would receive payment in two weeks. Since then, nothing for the last 6 weeks.

Flew to Kuala Lumpur with British Airways on an old Boeing 777-200 in business class (upgrade) which was OK although choice of IFE very poor. Crew pleasant but not particularly efficient and since my wife and I were seated together in the middle rear-facing seats it is an odd practice to serve us separately - her meals were served well before mine. Flight was punctual and we had a few hours sleep. Coming back was in Premium Economy and might as well have been on a different airline. Same old plane with TV screens extremely small. Meals not particularly great. The main difference is that British Airways crew treat anybody flying in a lower class as lesser individuals and they are bordering on rude.

"Washington to Dubai via London return with British Airways. My concern is regarding seat allocation. When we booked our flight (2 adults, one child and one infant), the seats with the bassinets for the infants were not available. We then chose 3 seats together on the side. I presumed that those are granted first come first served, based on the needs of the passengers that are traveling with children. Nonetheless, in 3 out of the 4 flights we took, those seats were taken by single individuals with no children/infants accompanying them. I asked at the check in if the seats with the bassinets were occupied by people with infants and the ground attendant responded by ""yes"". That was not the case, unfortunately. The flights were therefore very uncomfortable due to not having a place for the infant while food and drinks were served. I do not understand that when you try to book those seats with the bassinet, the system does not grant priority to the people traveling with infants. British Airways should consider that instead of having passengers with the hassle of keeping their infants on their laps for 7-8 hours while the bassinets are empty. The priority seating chart is for that purpose useful.

"I think one word sums it up 'Rubbish'. The London to Barbados flight was passable, however the return journey was a joke. It started at Grantley Adams airport where passengers were bumped off the flight through overbooking, we fortunately, were there early enough to be able to get onto the flight. We sat down and found that the seat in front of me was broken, so I had to spend the eight hour flight with the seat in my face, the gentleman in front was very apologetic however it was not his fault. There were no headsets and only two cots on board, in spite of numerous babies needing this facility, leading to very fractious and tired little ones, a nightmare for parents I would presume. Next the food, abysmal! A choice of peri peri chicken or pasta with tomato and cheese, no cheese and a thick horrible overpowering spicy tomato sauce, revolting. The tea and coffee was served at the same time as the food so if you wanted to eat and have wine, by the time you got to your tea or coffee it was cold - (obviously cabin crew in a hurry to clear). Breakfast was an all time low, a cold congealed croissant with a little butter and jam plus what can only be described as a bird seed bar. I have travelled with British Airways for more than 40 years and have never had food like this on a long haul flight, or in face any flight. Many years ago when I used to travel from Singapore and Malaysia with British Airways the food was excellent, even in economy, menu, three choices of main meals and cooked breakfast that was always very good. The cabin crew could not care less and somehow fail to realise that we, the customer, actually pay their wages. I asked for milk for my tea instead of the creamer for coffee that was provided albeit in miniscule amounts and was told by cabin crew that the creamer was ok.

I travel quite often to Europe and elsewhere but have avoided flying British Airways due to bad experiences in the past. However I decided to try the airline again - and a big mistake! Checked in online and selected a widow seat near the front of the aircraft. On arriving at LGW I was informed my seat had been unilaterally changed to an aisle seat at the rear of the aircraft! I am absolutely disgusted by such treatment. No other airline has done that to me ever in 20 years of flying. As a result of this I shall now try even harder to avoid flying British Airways whenever possible. Oh and the flight was delayed and the boarding staff were slow and inefficient.

"British Airways online check in policy is now most appalling. Four times I have flown with them and three times myself and my girlfriend have been placed apart. This is even though we were on the same booking and once this has happened in business. British Airways charge you just for selecting a seat. Not a better seat, just any seat other than that automatically selected for you! The system seems designed to deliberately place you apart, even though it knows that you are together. Then it charges you £18 per seat to change your seat. If neither you or your partner have an empty seat next to you then you have to pay to move both seats just to be together. They also won't let you checkin until 24 hours before so you have to spend one hour of your holiday going online and paying for the privilege of sitting together. Both these practices are archaic, even with Ryanair, they place you together in the system and if you pay to change you get priority boarding. Monarch only charge you to get a better quality seat.

As BA have 3 daily flights to Hannover and potentially 60+ users of the facility, I could have been forgiven to thinking there might be some decent food around. Wrong! The meal was a bunch of dried up sausages in a steamer that looked like samples in a medical lab. Ghastly. A few bits of cheese here and there and that was it. I quickly moved on and had an excellent dinner in the Movenpick restaurant a few meters away.  Only three passenger in Club and the plane pushed back 5 minutes early.

"This review covers my usual return trip from London Heathrow to Dubai. Both flights are overnight and I use points to upgrade to business. It was a Boeing 777 going out and Boeing 747 on the return trip. There was nothing really wrong with either flight but I only really use them for the timings and the flat bed to get some sleep. I don't like the weird front to back 2x4x2 layout and cannot forsee how much longer British Airways can get away with this as it is so out of date with modern standards. It is fine if you get a window seat and no one attached to you. Having watched the seating pattern filling up over several months I eventually paid £136 extra to reserve a window seat both ways. After a couple of hours the bed is very hard and the storage is almost non existent. That said, the crew were polite and served well. They seemed to be older and I think that makes the difference, they understand customer service. On the return, one cabin crew in particular was very responsive and helpful in offering tea mid flight. Overall the product is outdated and this time the service was good. It got me there and back safely and I was fed and watered.

"I regularly travel British Airways to LCY and LHR and found them to be nothing more than a glorified Ryanair in terms of service. I also flew a longer sector (Kiev to London) last week and it was awful. On the A319 they only have 1 toilet at the rear of the plane for all economy passenger. On a 4 hour flight this resulted in massive queues discomforting passenger on the last 4-5 rows as well as long waits for those actually using the loo. The food was horrendous (Chicken Kiev!) and the air hostesses were surly, abrupt and really uninterested and unfriendly. I don't want them to do the fake smile and friendliness thing, but these girls and guys were genuinely unhappy and unfriendly. As for my regular weekly or biweekly flights between Dublin and LCY or LHR, the E170 service to LCY is ok, it's punctual, and you get a stale croissant for breakfast on it. What really annoys me is how British Airways treats its frequent flyers, makes it impossible to get any meaningful benefit from BA despite having travelled numerous times with them (every other week at least!) and paid hundreds of pounds in fares that are usually well above the competition. They also have this ""seat selection"" fee for their bronze members if they book a hand luggage only fare. They cite that these fares are there to make it competitive but they really are not anywhere near competitive on routes they sell from Dublin and the treatment of regular flyers and bronze members leaves a lot to be desired (it's basically meaningless: I would have far better service on Cityjet or Aer Lingus which both server those routes, for a lower fare, while being able to choose my seat for free at check-in time).

"I decided to fly British Airways as it is now the only oneworld carrier with Premium Economy between Sydney and Singapore, since Qantas now only runs A330s with Business and basic economy into Singapore. It was a pleasant surprise with very good service and food and a pleasant ambience onboard. Almost all passengers were flying onto London and this also applied to the return run from Singapore, with almost all passengers originating in London. This means that for the return flight from Singapore most other people had slept all the way from London and were chatting and moving about the cabin, meaning it was almost impossible to get any sleep on the relatively short overnight flight between Singapore to Sydney. So, if you don't mind skipping any sleep between Singapore and Sydney this is a nice alternative when planning to fly from Australia to Singapore and return.

The new British Airways lounge at Cape Town is a big improvement on the lounge that used to be shared with Virgin, however it filled up quickly with passengers for the two flights.

In addition, there are screens between and your neighbor's seat which flight attendants have to move up and down when they want to serve passengers who do not have an aisle seat. I can't imagine how stupid the person who created this layout must have been. It is not comfortable for passengers nor is it for flight attendants. Very sticky atmosphere due to this odd arrangement of seats. In terms of service, this was lousy on both flights. There are about 4 flight attendants for about 40 Business Class seats. The flight attendants are quite old. It takes them a long time to get you something to drink on the table after take-off. They move through the cabin twice with drinks before they serve dinner and desert. Afterwards you don't see them and they may not show up even if you press the call button.

"Flight and crew great, the problems came when we had to deal with the Orlando check in staff and customer complaints in uk. Total nightmare and they just did not care at all. Our seats were booked 3 months in advance as we had a small baby with us. When arriving at Orlando airport to return home the check in agent changed our seats to mid row and no bassinets. We noticed before going through security and returned to advise to get our seats that we had booked back. This turned into 2 hours of sheer hell with the staff (including airport manager) while my baby screamed the place down hungry, as we could not go through security until they had rectified the problem.

"Heathrow to Las Vegas with British Airways, and a farcical flight to be honest. 2 hours into a 10 hour flight running out of beer for those who drink is a joke.

"Gatwick to Venice with British Airways. The plane was clean, crew good and reasonably on time, with good check in. But the flight was made unpleasant by BA encouraging people to take so much cabin baggage on to the plane. The return flight was perhaps 80% full, but the overhead lockers were full. It causes a scrum at boarding. The back row passengers board first and stowed their cases at the front so they don't have to carry them down the plane.

"Round trip London to Luanda in British Airways business class (Club World). It's really below average. British Airways seems stand still in the competition with other airlines. The seats are cramped. There are no storage for personal items. The seats and toilets were not adequately cleaned up after previous flight. The food and IFE were average for business class. British Airways should think about improving the cabin in general or otherwise they will continue to fall behind their competitors. Even American Airlines and Iberia, which practically owned by same company, have improved a lot. The only positive thing was the FAs in both legs were polite and courteous.

"Not impressed with British Airways at all. We flew back from Denver after visiting family. We flew out with Lufthansa as they were the cheapest as we usualy fly to the Middle/Far east with them and know the standards and quality they have to offer. Our return Lufthansa flight home was cancelled due to flight attendant strikes at Lufthansa. We were booked straight on to the BA flight back to London which left only an hour later. Initially we were excited to fly with British Airways as it would've been our first time flying with them and also they fly a B747-400 from Denver to Europe. I am aware that the Boeing 747-400 isn't the newest aircraft, however Lufthansa had re-done the interior with new seats and side panels so very up to date inside. With British Airways the whole interior was very old and dirty, the seats hadn't been changed and the TV's in the back of the seats were such poor quality it was embarrassing. The food was of a poor standard - chicken meal I had was horrendous and even the flight attendant didnt know what she was serving. When asked what chicken dish it was, she replied ""some sort of curry thing"" when it was actually Chicken Teryaki. The air hostess was rude, the breakfast snack which was served before landing was also not very good, and cereal bar was rock hard. British Airways were double the price of Lufthansa when we initially booked, however I would never choose to fly with the again out of my own choice. Their Boeing 747's are dated which is a massive shame. Stick to an airline you know well, Lufthansa are the best European airline all round that I have used, and Emirates was the best internationally. I hope this review was helpful - obviously I am aware some customers would have had a better experience than me on newer planes with different food and air hostesses, however be aware when booking with British Airways as they are very over rated and not good value for money.

"Roundtrip with British Airways from Bangkok to London in Club World. Really the only good thing to talk about is the baggage allowance. The seats are horrid. Cramped and you feel like you're in a coffin if you have the backward-facing window seats. It's unbelievably cramped and when I pay more than 4x the economy ticket, I expect a place to keep a water bottle when the seat is in bed-mode. The main meal outbound was not heated and had to be returned.  The pre-ordered beef on the inbound was dry. Changed it for the cold King prawn salad with couscous only to be told it was actually chicken. The bathrooms are hideous and there's no distinction between economy and business. Blocked washbasin, tissue fibres all over the place, stained walls and peeling finishes. Crew outbound were older and very pleasant. Inbound was a much younger crew and only one (Spanish lady) was truly aware of passenger needs. The rest were more intent on getting to Bangkok to party than to serve passengers with a smile. Boarding at LHR they were all in the galley blocking access to the other side of the cabin, chattering to each other and not one welcome or eye-contact after entering the door. The Club Word lounge meal offerings at T5 were abysmal. More like a school canteen. If anyone from BA reads these opinions, then please do something about your dreadful IFE.

"Awful customer service. My wife and I have flown with British Airways for almost 30 years, I booked a flight through the Executive club, which we are members of, nine months before travelling. Less than 4 weeks later we realised we would need to cancel, and after almost 1 hour on the phone on hold I decided to hang up and do it online. This seemed to be a simple process with a final message of ""we are processing your request"".  After no confirmation at all, I received my credit card statement to find a refund from BA of under £250 - my booking was over £2500. After a call to customer services I was I will not get any further refund or be able to reinstate the flights. There was nobody else to talk to, and if I emailed any of the BA executives it would be forwarded to customer services and they would not reply!

"British Airways First class seats are very good compared to their business class. Truly a great experience. Loving the windows, there’s a cover that can open, shade or close. The pods are quite private. 1-2-1 configuration.  Service very attentive and personal. They will address you by name the moment you walk in, escort you to your seat and supply welcome drinks, towels, etc. Food is reasonable to good. If you don’t like (parts) of the meals, you can replace from (parts) of other sets, turning it in fact into semi- a-la-carte. Return flight was over-booked. By phone and email they contacted me and with my permission I was rebooked onto 1st class SQ flight at same day at more or less the same time.  In all, it was a very pleasant experience.  The Singapore lounge does not have a 1st class section and is mixed with business class. Fare difference between business class and 1st class is not as huge as with some other airlines.

"I was among the several hundred passengers whose British Airways flight was canceled last night from Dallas Ft Worth to London. No status indicating canceled was put on the displays at the gate, once the decision was made. They were not updated. People were told to call 1-800-AIRWAYS for help, but were turned away by the phone system, and as a result lost their places in line. One woman had a glimmer of hope with the phone system, only to be told that because she was traveling with a baby, she had to go back and wait in line. Only 4 ticket counters were open to assist the passengers, and each passenger took over 20-30 minutes to help, on average. One couple took approximately 2 hours to be helped because they were booked to go on a cruise for their anniversary and this delay cost them their connection. They were not able to get any arrangements that would get them to their cruise for another 3 days. The couple will now miss half their cruise. No screening was performed to get people with important connecting flights (like that couple or myself) close to the front of the line. There were two other flights out to LHR that night that would have allowed me to still make my tour, but due to the disorganization of the help, I missed both, even though one was 5.5 hours after the original cancellation. It did not help that the British Airways staff blatantly allowed people to cut in line, for no reason. I was still in time to make the last flight out at 10:10pm, but a couple was allowed to cut in front of me in line and as a result by the time my new bookings were made it was too late. People were falling out of line because there was no area to rest, or provisions made for food or going to the restroom. The customers were too exhausted to stand for that long. No attempt to ""take a number"" and call people back was made for the comfort of customers. Not even water was passed out during the 6 hour waiting period. The counter staff, and how they were managed, was completely inadequate. The way British Airways handled this cancellation was atrocious! Things break, including airplanes, which is understood, but the manner in which a company recovers from such debacles says a great deal about their character. I am sorely disappointed in how this was dealt with. I will now miss the first, and arguably most anticipated, part of my tour to India, and my traveling companion (coming from Atlanta) will be there alone, which is not safe for a young, single female.

"My mother's flight from London to Moscow was cancelled. While understanding that these things happen, and accepting this inconvenience, it is the customer service of British Airways that I found outrageous. First of all, British Airways would refuse to speak to me (paying customer), as they had incorrect data in the ticket purchase details - despite the fact that I had any proof they may need, and all contact details in the ticket purchase data were mine. But fair enough, there is more. They couldn't speak to my mother (she doesn't speak English, they don't speak Russian), and while I was trying to offer various options to customer service agents, time passed. By the time (several hours later) I suggested their Moscow office calls my mother to confirm her identity, it was too late - Moscow office was closed, and all was offered is for my mother to call then next day. Needless to say, she had to travel next day, and it was unacceptable option. So, At no point my mother was offered anything required by Regulations 261/2004, Articles 8, 9 and 14 - so BA appears to be in breach of those regulations. I bought a ticket for my mother with Aeroflot instead, for a flight at a similar time to that cancelled by BA, and asked BA for refund. BA in turn (and after my mother travelled to Moscow) demanded a letter of authority from her, otherwise they would refuse to speak to me. They would not, for example, call my mother in Moscow and simply ask her.  My mother sent me letter of authority, which I forwarded to the BA. Now they would speak to me, and promised refund and compensation. This was on 30th September 2015. On 20th October 2015, (20 days after - Regulations state that refund must be made within seven days) I chased this with BA. I was promised a refund and compensation again. As of today (6 November 2015), nothing was paid to me yet. Customer service responds with generic messages, themed ""We are sorry for the delay, the refund will be with you soon"". My requests are simply ignored. So, while it might be a reasonably comfortable airline when everything works well, I would encourage everyone to very seriously consider how you will be treated in an event of a delay or cancellation.

"Geneva to Beijing via LHR. First flights on British Airways for six years - not because I was avoiding them, I just did not fly much.

Breakfast was a cooked breakfast with muesli starter, orange juice and a bread roll. Coffee refills were offered. The flight landed on time.

I understand that because of the row, both the table and screen were in the arm rests, but by the time I had used a cardigan and the blanket to pad out the arm rests (very hard on the elbows) I felt very cramped. My immediate neighbour kept messing with his seat and was eventually moved as he said it would not recline. Later I tried mine (no one behind me) and, the same, it would not recline. Breakfast was a wholemeal croissant just out of the fridge - yuk. The British Airways check in staff at Newark are so surly and miserable. Whoever made the tanoy annoucements for boarding had an accent so that I could not distinguish what she was saying. On my outgoing trip and arrival at USA customs queue I realised that I did not have the customs entry form. Seems I should have been given one to complete by the BA check-in person.

She was difficult and surly throughout. She told us we could not sit together and dotted us around the aircraft. This would have been accepted had she not insisted that an infant in our party had to sit with a 15 yr old boy and not with its mother. We then asked the supervisor to intervene and guess what we were all seated together so it was possible all the time. By the time we had been checked in the whole of the rest of the plane had been checked in by the 2 other staff. This was a dreadful agent representation of BA, the UK's flag ship airline. I feel BA need to know how their passengers are treated by agent staff. I have not included this experience in my rating of BA.

"Return British Airways flight from Heathrow to Las Vegas. The cabin crew were very good, helpful and friendly. However, the quality of the seatback screens and the seats are very tired, and very oudated. The films and tv shows are good, however the quality of the screen is poor, compared to other airlines. The seats are also well past their serviceable life. Other airlines offer far better seats and entertainment so it is rather disappointing British Airways don't. Even other, newer, BA planes have far superior seats and VOD, to which it is shocking the difference in the service offered for economy class, there isn't even a charging port in the Boeing 747 when there is on the newer planes.

"Lisbon to London on 2nd November was like many other flights affected by the thick fog which forced cancellation and delays of so many flights into Heathrow. The plane was boarded at normal departure time, just in case this flight got a slot into Heathrow, and kept informed of developments by the flight deck. Since at one point it appeared likely our slot might not open up till 16.00 (scheduled at 10.20) the food and drink service was started, and cabin crew did a great job keeping a congenial atmosphere in the cabin whilst doing this. Eventually we did get a slot at 14.00 and got into Heathrow round 16.30. It was quite stressful for those passengers who had connections to make (I did make my connection that afternoon to Washington), but the stress was reduced by continuous up-to-the-minute information from the flight deck and service from cabin crew.

"Philadelphia to Athens via Heathrow with British Airways. The lack of service amazed me since I have flown both first and business on many airlines. The Club World menu listed 2 Starter items, 3 Main choices, and 4 desserts. I chose the Grilled halloumi and portobello mushroom starter. If it was grilled, it must have been a long time before it was refrigerated. Not too good. The fillet was like a piece of old shoe leather. I will admit that it might be difficult to come up with a medium rare steak but this was bad. I was never give a choice of desserts but found a piece of pie on my tray along with the starter and steak. I was never offered coffee and had to stop an attendant and ask for some. I was not offered any after dinner drink. In short, the service was rushed and more like a coach class. It appeared that the attendants were trying to get rid of us and get us to sleep rather than serve us. I was very disappointed and would avoid British Airways business class.

"After flying with BA long haul for the first time on one of their newer A380s, the flight back to LHR was with their B747-400 which is my favourite aircraft along with the A340-400. Ground service at SFO was efficient. Purchased extra luggage and was still 2kg over my limit on each bag of which the check in agent was considerate enough to let me off. My guess was that the flight was not full as there was virtually no one at the check in counters. I was wrong, the gate was packed. Considering I had 3 pieces of carry on luggage, I wasn't asked to put one of them on the hold. The flight was delayed by approximately 1 hour. Boarding was smooth and efficient. Upon boarding, passengers were having trouble storing their carry on resulting in me storing mine some 4-5 rows behind. The seat is no surprise, their older product with the outdated IFE. Cabin temperature was boiling. Passengers were requesting FAs to turn it down a little which they have mid way through the flight when everyone was asleep. The seat pitch on the Boeing 747-400 is 31 inches pitch in economy class. Compared to their A380 product, the cabin felt cramped. Although the seat was comfortable itself to sit on, it just felt cramped. I had the most uncomfortable long haul flights in my entire life., the flight became more and more unbearable and wasn't able to get any sleep at all. I was constantly trying to find a comfortable position for me to have nap but it was impossible and worse when the person in front of you reclines. To make things worse, the IFE was very unreliable compared to the A380. I fly with BA frequently on European routes where their economy cabin product is negligible due to the flight times but I would try and not fly with BA's product on their B747s. Inflight meals were rather disappointing. Service was rushed and FA's showed no enthusiasm. First meal was bland roast chicken. Landing meal was an English breakfast considering we were arriving at lunch time.

"I flew with British Airways for my family holiday to and from Sharm El Sheikh from London Gatwick. I checked in online both ways 24 hours before which was fine and all went well. However, I have a special dietary need and I was not able to click on this for the flight. With BA, you get meals, snacks and drinks included so I knew that we would have a meal with a 5 hour flight. While on board, I was able to choose the fruit option for breakfast on the way there - however on the way back it was a cold deli option which consisted of a wrap, a roll and some crackers. I asked if there was a gluten free option and the assistant said ""No just this"". Following this we could have pretzels and biscuits with a drink. Obviously someone like me who is a coeliac cannot eat anything with wheat/gluten so I was left with a slab of cheese which should have gone with the crackers. BA really need to address this as it is not fair to advertise they provide meals on board when clearly there was nothing available for me.

The lounge at Heathrow was not crowded and boarding was prompt. I had pre booked my seat, rear facing by the window. I was sitting comfortably when a Japanese gentleman arrived and told me I was sitting in his seat. I told him it was my seat. I asked to see his boarding pass which was for my seat. I showed him my electronic boarding pass which was for the same seat. At this stage the Purser was passing and we raised the issue. I decided to stand my ground as I was happy with my pre booked seat. The Purser went away to investigate. When he returned, he apologised for the error and quietly asked me to follow him and said I would not be disappointed.

"Checked in online prior to departure expecting to use a British Airways online check in desk or fast bag drop on arrival at Manchester Airport. BA used to have a fast bag drop desk for customers who have checked in online. When I enquired as to where it was on arrival at Manchester Airport I was directed to the back of the long check in queue by a surly check in agent who stated, ""We don't have one. You have to join the back of the queue"". In that case what on earth is the benefit of checking in online?! It serves no purpose whatsoever. The shuttle down to Manchester was delayed by about an hour as was our onward flight from LHR to LAS. This flight was on one of their ancient B747-400 aircraft which was 25 years old, and it showed. The seats in economy were extremely uncomfortable for a 10.5 hour flight and there was no legroom. Inflight entertainment options were poor. I have never undertaken such an uncomfortable flight. The in flight catering was mediocre but the cabin crew provided good service. Our return flight from LAS to LHR was delayed by an hour and although we had booked to travel in and out from T5 at LHR I received an email half way through my trip informing me that we would be flying into T3 at LHR. As we were already delayed into LHR, by the time we had crossed to T5 our connecting flight to Manchester had already departed and we had to be booked onto another flight which meant we had been travelling for a total of 26 hours by the time we got home. BA made sure our travel experience was as miserable and inconvenient as possible. I have decided after many issues of late with BA that I can no longer be bothered with the hassle.

"I recently got an unexpected upgrade to World Traveller Plus whilst on my way to New York. There was free cava before take-off and a random hot towel handed out. The seat was roomy and leg room was fantastic. Even more so because I was at the front of the World Traveller Plus cabin just after Club World, so there were no seats in front of me. Inflight entertainment was ok, but not as good as I was expecting. I did struggle to find things that interested me to watch as the choice was quite limited. I think now with early digital release of many films on things like i-Tunes, the days of being able to see really recent films on aircraft before they become more widely available are coming to an end. As I was at the front of the cabin I had a screen that folded out of my armrest, which meant I was looking down at the screen instead of straight ahead, which gave me a bit of a neck ache after awhile. It was also annoying to stow away. The food was good for airline food. You get a superior meal in World Traveller Plus and it was pretty tasty and filling. The pre-landing snack wasn't up to much though. It was a dull sandwich, much like those that BA hand out on short-haul European flights. A real bonus about being in World Traveller Plus is that you're closer to the front of the plane and the exit. This is useful when arriving in the US where immigration queues can sometimes be exceptionally long. I ended up being close to the front of the immigration queue as I was so quick off the plane, which meant I was out through immigration pretty quickly.

"First ever long haul trip with British Airways as I usually fly with Cathay Pacific or KLM so I thought I'd give BA a chance. Ground service at London/Heathrow Terminal 5 is smooth and no hassle. Check in and security was very fast and efficient. I particularly like BA's boarding procedure at Heathrow, very orderly and organised regardless of the fullness of the flight. Onboard the A380 is BA's new 'World Traveller' cabin on the main deck at 3x4x3 configuration. BA offers 31.5 inches legroom compared to CX's 32 inches and it was surprisingly very comfortable with the slim design seats. IFE had a few glitches but the FA's were happy to assist and worked perfectly throughout the flight. However, more movies, TV programmes and music options could be offered. Meals were mediocre. Drinks were served around an hour after take off. Meals followed straight after. Lunch meal option was either curry, vegetarian pasta or chicken and often for the latter. Surprisingly good but still not as good as CX. Portions could be better. Drinks were offered throughout the flight along with snack boxes. Pre-landing meal was also given with two options: pasta or chicken casserole, I went for the latter. Again, portions could be better.

"San Francisco to Edinburgh via London with British Airways. Upon arrival at Edinburgh Airport we waited over an hour before we were informed, only after seeking out the information ourselves as opposed to an announcement of any kind being made, that our luggage was lost at Heathrow - along with 500 other bags. Things happen, and can be forgiven; it's what happened after the fact that is so completely appalling. We were not given any vouchers or helped in any way by the baggage claim people or by the customer service desk. We were told that our bags would be delivered to us in 24 hours. Since we going to be in a different place every night as we traveled through Scotland, we gave them the address of the B&B where we would be the following night, essentially giving them more than the 24 hours to get our bags to us. We received a text saying that the bags were out for delivery. They did not arrive. In the next seven days, I spent an average of 2.5 hours a day on the phone with the call center in India who were absolutely no help at all. The customer service phone line at BA was not being answered, and the supposed courier service phones lines (2 of them) were gone out of service as well. I emailed both the courier service and BA customer service and did not receive a response from either one. Still, the courier website listed our luggage as being out for delivery. On the evening of the fifth day, it took 45 minutes to get a supervisor on the line (in India) who took another hour to tell me that the baggage claim area in Edinburgh was closed and there was nothing she could do. The bags were continually listed as being out for delivery, but they never showed up. We were never contacted, and neither was the B&B where we had had them (supposedly) sent. On the morning of the sixth day, on yet another call to India, I stated that the extra medicines my friend had brought with her on the plane had run out and that I was going to have to consider taking her to the hospital. Then, in a few hours we received a call from a nice chap at the Edinburgh baggage claim who said he had both bags right there, that they had never been out for delivery at all. We would be in Tarbert on Harris the next night and he had them flown out to us. Seven days after our arrival in Edinburgh. During the seven days, we had to purchase clothes to wear. We missed doing some of the things we had planned to do because of the time spent on the phone with BA and the time spent shopping for clothes. When we made the return flight, we had to pay for an extra checked bag to accommodate the clothing we had purchased. Finally, a month later, we have received a note of intended compensation from British Airways - for the amount of the clothing only. Not anything for the extra bag that we checked that contained clothes that we shouldn't have needed to buy or to check through, and only needed to do so due to the incompetence of British Airways. That's completely on them, and we should be reimbursed for the charges.

I advise anyone in First/Business/World Traveller Plus to use this facility. World traveller Plus is definitely an 'enhanced economy' versus some airlines premium economy which is more a 'business minus'. So keep expectations in check. You get a bigger seat, pre take off drink, little amenity kit and a slightly upgraded meal.

I have no idea how a flight can leave early or how you can leave without 30 passengers. The attendant at the desk merely informed these passengers that the desk was closed and they should return tomorrow. It was 3.00 on a Saturday afternoon. Nothing was offered to help these passengers get to their final destination. After calling multiple times and sending various emails, I was ""granted"" a refund. My full refund offer came with a $50 cancellation fee and a $40 service fee. I have yet to accept the offer. We never cancelled her flight nor received anything that looks like service. Do not fly this airline. They are inept and have no idea what customer service is. There is no 'value for money' when the flight departs early.

"My wife and I recently flew to California, outbound on A380 into LAX, returning to LHR from SFO on Boeing 747-400. Both legs in WT+ (Premium Economy). The Boeing 747-400 is very tired aircraft who BA seemingly are not investing in at all. The plastic surrounding the blind was coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just very old, tired and tatty. Despite BA insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the A380, it felt far more cramped, and much more like normal WT (Economy). Not helped by the Multimedia box and seat legs of the seat in front in exactly the wrong place to stretch out. The TV screens are very small and an old square format with far more limited programming compared with the A380. On the meal service, they ran out of the beef choice half way around the cabin service leaving only a vegetarian option (the helpful cabin crew did eventually find one from business class as WT+ gets the business class entree) but only as they had one left over. I feel if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice the price of WT) with the word ""Premium"" in the title you should expect a premium product. BA do not offer free pre-seating (unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to be seated together if the flight is full or near full), priority check-in, priority boarding, the pre-take-off drink is orange juice or water on all inbound flights. Additionally, despite BA boarding by seat row numbers, this was ignored by most passengers and ground staff alike so by the time we were called to board, the WT+ cabin was already full with very limited room for our carry on luggage, so it lucky that we travel very light! As you can tell, overall I feel that this was a lot of money for very little in return. Based upon our experience, I would recommend the WT+ in the A380 but only when departing from the UK (you can pre-order your meal and they serve wine as a pre-take off). In addition, WT+ on the 380 is upstairs in a small, cosy cabin, light and airy with a very useful storage bin on the window seats. These may be small points on their own, but combine to take the shine off a very expensive upgrade.",4,2015-10-27, United Kingdom ,False,wife recently flew california outbound lax returning lhr sfo boeing leg wt premium economy boeing tired aircraft ba seemingly investing plastic surrounding blind coming away footrest attached seat front go way resulting uncomfortable seating position rest aircraft area old tired tatty despite ba insisting seat pitch felt far cramped much like normal wt economy helped multimedia box seat leg seat front exactly wrong place stretch tv screen small old square format far limited programming compared meal service ran beef choice half way around cabin service leaving vegetarian option helpful cabin crew eventually find one business class wt get business class entree one left feel pay service near make difference twice price wt word premium title expect premium product ba offer free pre seating unless book hour departure thus cannot guarantee seated together flight full near full priority check priority boarding pre take drink orange juice water inbound flight additionally despite ba boarding seat row number ignored passenger ground staff alike time called board wt cabin already full limited room carry luggage lucky travel light tell overall feel lot money little return based upon experience would recommend wt departing uk pre order meal serve wine pre take addition wt upstairs small cosy cabin light airy useful storage bin window seat may small point combine take shine expensive upgrade

"Endured horrible British Airways return flights from Heathrow to Cape Town. The plane seems to be from the 1980s. Somehow the seats are really narrow, so that anyone with remotely broad shoulders spills over onto the seats next to them. I couldn't fit between a larger man one one side and a woman on the other and resorted to leaning forward for much of the flight. Thankfully a child was on one side on the way back. There were a number of flyers on the plane who had clearly done the route before as many refused to sit togther, forcing first-time flyers on the route like me to be squashed between them. The seats were also incredibly uncomfortable. The moulding on the back was took narrow and dug into my bag. I only fell asleep through sheer exhaustion, but woke up repeatedly with back pain from the seat. Other passengers walked around the cabin throughout the flight, while some resorted to sitting in the flight attendants' seats. Also the seats in front of the toilets don't fully recline. The TV controls are fixed into the arm rests which makes them uncomfortable to put your arm on and you inevitably press one of the buttons accidentally. The TVs themselves are about 30 years old, small and poor quality. The selection of movies was not great. It was very hot onboard the plane, and passengers repeatedly asked for the air conditioning to be turned up. The service was good on the way out, but the return flight service was poor. The staff appeared disinterested. One flight attendant responded rudely to me when I asked if I could use the overhead locker above my seat that had her bag in it. Another told the child next to me, when he asked for Sprite with his dinner, they had run out. Even though I saw a flight attendant drinking a can of Sprite 30 minutes later. Generally they seemed more interested in rushing through the service and stuffing their mouths than helping anyone. My call button was ignored twice. Another passenger pressed their's and the attendant simply came and turned it off then walked away. She said she'd be back in a moment, but didn't return.

"British Airways still trade on the 'you are lucky to be flying with us' mentality. 8am on a Friday morning, at the 'flagship' terminal at home base, and there are just 3 business class check-in desks open, so queued for nearly 30 minutes just to drop a bag. South Gallery lounge more like a refugee centre than a premier cabin lounge. People sleeping across sofas and chairs, full to almost standing-room only, but managed to perch on the arm of a sofa, before giving it up as a waste of time. Boarding very low-key, quick and easy. Excellent crew and very surprised by the level and quality of catering, and looked after well. It's the hardware that's so far below par. Business class seating is 8 across, that's like a lot of economy cabins. A window seat felt very cramped and claustrophobic. The cabin wall curved inwards and the seat is directly underneath where the hand-luggage bins sit, so it's quite an exercise to extricate yourself.

I was originally booked to fly from London City to Geneva first thing in the morning but the flight got cancelled. I did not receive so much as an email from BA about this. The only way I found it was cancelled was by going into my original confirmation email as the flight did not even register on the British Airways App. My replacement flight was from Heathrow so I had to make my way all the way across London (at my own expense) to get that flight which then ended up being delayed by 1 hour!

"There are so many poor reviews here for British Airways, and I am just about to add another one. The return trip started in the shared lounge at Pisa. Its comfortable enough - but forget it if you are hungry. There is no food to snack on - just a few bags of crisps, nuts and sealed croissants. Booze choice is okay. Quite why, in Italy of all places, a platter of mixed meats, cheeses and typical antipasti cannot be provided - probably costing about £50 a day, is a mystery. British Airways don't care. No airbridge so a trudge to the plane. It was an ex BMI A319 and given they ceased trading three years ago one would think that the internal software could be changed to show British Airways branding and not BMI; very strange. Old BA Club Europe. Tired seats. FAs were fine. Food mediocre. Funny thing was the cabin smelt of a rather tasty ""meaty"" sort of meal. As we took off I was starving and full of optimism. All we got was a miserable afternoon tea; dried sandwiches, scones and jam. I compensated my gloom with a few gin and tonics. I asked myself, is this ""worth it"" - the extra for the product. What you get I suppose is a toilet for 12/14 passengers, compared with two toilets between 120 or so.  Wider seats (no extra legroom).  A meal over economy but not by much,  glasses to drink from rather than plastic beakers and a faster exit from the plane,  a few extra AVIOS points - that's it basically! Not a lot.

"Trip got off to a disappointing start with the British Airways lounge crammed to the rafters. We struggled to find a seat. Breakfast choice was okay, nothing exciting. The second lounge below floor has long been closed and shows no sign of re-opening. Classic BA thinking regular flyers wont notice - but we do! The furniture, seats etc are long overdue for replacement. All very tatty. The plane was quite new, clean, but had the old Club Europe seats which is neither here or there. We were in 1A and 1C and had decent leg room. Took off 40 minutes late due to delays at Pisa - and some runway modifications (or so we were told).

"I arrived at Heathrow after travelling for over 20 hours flying from Perth, Australia, to London. I had booked my British Airways flight online, and as I had not been to Heathrow before gave myself plenty of time to get through Customs and from Terminal 3 to Terminal 5. Total cost for return flights was $240.89Aus (113.68 pounds). I had booked the 8.05pm Heathrow flight to Belfast City Airport, but had got through Customer and to Terminal 5 just after 5pm. I went the to BA information desk to see if I could get an earlier flight. I was told yes, there was a flight leaving in about 30 minutes and if I paid for the change of outgoing flight it would not be a problem. I was told I would have to pay 110.00 pounds ($232.99 Aus) so I could get the earlier flight. Because I had been travelling for so long and just wanted to get to Belfast I paid the money.

"Checkin at Gatwick no problem at premium check in. Quickly through the fast track lane at Security,  the lounge at Gatwick was fairly busy though there was plenty of seating available. Flight boarded on time but by bus from a remote stand. Onboard service was efficient and friendly. Business Class has middle seat blocked out and turned into a table, armrest moved apart to give a wider seat than in economy.

"Never again with British Airways. Could not book seats, arrived into Rome (connecting flight) to be told there was no lounge facilities (no advanced notice, was not offered apology or use of other lounge or even a voucher). The flight and onboard service disappointing, business class seats are the same as economy apart from a tray secured to the middle seat which made getting in and out near imposable. Food laughable (3 finger sandwiches). No inflight entertainment. In sum, I will never fly British Airways again.",5,2015-10-15, Malaysia ,False,never british airway could book seat arrived rome connecting flight told lounge facility advanced notice offered apology use lounge even voucher flight onboard service disappointing business class seat economy apart tray secured middle seat made getting near imposable food laughable finger sandwich inflight entertainment sum never fly british airway
"This British Airways trip was one of the worst experiences I have had. The Business Class seating was terrible, requiring literally stepping over (and sometimes on) my fellow passengers. Additionally, I was facing backwards while flying. The service was poor, food barely edible, the lounge lacking in nearly every way from dirty tables, torn furniture and lack of power outlets. I suggest doing everything you can to avoid this airline. Their competitors exceed them.",2,2015-10-15, United States ,False,british airway trip one worst experience business class seating terrible requiring literally stepping sometimes fellow passenger additionally facing backwards flying service poor food barely edible lounge lacking nearly every way dirty table torn furniture lack power outlet suggest everything avoid airline competitor exceed
"Check in was prompt but the fight was delayed 2 hours due to unexpected windshield wiper replacements. British Airways cabin crew was not the friendliest or most professional. I have never felt attendants to be so indifferent and self absorbed. I was never asked what I wanted to order. I was simply brought what they chose. I asked for sparkling water and was informed they had ""run out"". I asked for more bread, and was informed they has ""run out"". Dessert was down to one selection. In all, the service was lacking at best. The food was mediocre, and the selection was sub-par. The seats were comfortable and the pod seating was quite good. Flight entertainment is reminiscant of American Airlines from the 1990's, very very disappointing. The most disturbing was the three seatbelt checks all while my belt was visibly around the sleeping blanket. The ammenity kits are of economy class standard on most other airlines. Lavs were not kept clean. I can honestly say I will never fly British Airways again. This was a waste of a $5,000.00.",5,2015-10-15, United States ,False,check prompt fight delayed hour due unexpected windshield wiper replacement british airway cabin crew friendliest professional never felt attendant indifferent self absorbed never asked wanted order simply brought chose asked sparkling water informed run asked bread informed run dessert one selection service lacking best food mediocre selection sub par seat comfortable pod seating quite good flight entertainment reminiscant american airline disappointing disturbing three seatbelt check belt visibly around sleeping blanket ammenity kit economy class standard airline lav kept clean honestly say never fly british airway waste
"British Airways from London to Rome, almost perfect on my last 3 flights. Food was edible, the flight attendant very pleasant.

"London to Stockholm flight was delayed a little leaving Heathrow due to the typical congestion. Club Europe on British Airways 767 does not have the new seats, but comfortable for the two hour flight. Food was okay at best. The Heathrow Galleries lounge has little in the way of food selection. Drinks on board plentiful, FA's good.

"Originally booked with Easyjet, Manchester to Moscow and they cancelled my return flight without offering re-routing. Then re-booked with Brussels Airline and they had problems at Brussels with runway repairs but to their credit rebooked me with BA. Finally got my flight sorted with British Airways, comfortable, good food, great choice of films. They lost half a point because I went to the BA information desk at Moscow Airport and asked 'Do you speak English?' to a lady in BA uniform confidently expecting the answer ""of course"". I got a shake of the head and a finger pointed towards a colleague already engaged with another customer.",2,2015-10-14, United Kingdom ,False,originally booked easyjet manchester moscow cancelled return flight without offering routing booked brussels airline problem brussels runway repair credit rebooked ba finally got flight sorted british airway comfortable good food great choice film lost half point went ba information desk moscow airport asked speak english lady ba uniform confidently expecting answer course got shake head finger pointed towards colleague already engaged another customer
"Don't fly with British Airways, unless you don't have baggage or don't care about it. We took a connection flight via London LHR to San Diego and all our baggage (and of many other passengers in this flight), was delayed for two days. Other flyers told us this problem is frequent with BA. When our baggage finally arrived, one of the suitcases was damaged beyond repair. We filed a complaint, but so far (more than a month) heard nothing from them albeit several calls. Disgraceful attitude. As a final accord, on the return flight, we could not check online, for some unclear reason, while other passengers could. So my wife and I got separate middle seats.

"LHR-AMS-LHR checked in online which is quick and simple bag drop at T5 very quick, was able to use the lounge through my FFS which I like. Boarding on to a full flight quick and seats on an exit row comfy with lots of room for 1hr flight, aircraft clean and tidy a drink served, arrived on time and bags off pretty quick. Checked in on line for the return bag drop quick as was security, the gate D28 is a long walk from security. Used the BA lounge which while small is nice although not many food option.. Boarding for A321 took a while but departed on time and once on board the aircraft appeared new. Crew served a drink on the 50 minute flight arrived on time bags out quickly. All in all a decent service for a short flight.",4,2015-10-12, United Kingdom ,False,lhr am lhr checked online quick simple bag drop quick able use lounge ffs like boarding full flight quick seat exit row comfy lot room hr flight aircraft clean tidy drink served arrived time bag pretty quick checked line return bag drop quick security gate long walk security used ba lounge small nice although many food option boarding took departed time board aircraft appeared new crew served drink minute flight arrived time bag quickly decent service short flight
